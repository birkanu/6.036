-1	B000SP1WX6	A6EOFHR124MFN	farmers bros. coffee changed..?	I first tried this coffee at the Hungry Hunter restaurant, years ago. I thought it was the best coffee I ever tasted, and bought some that next day; right off their delivery truck. Hadn't had it anymore in yrs., till a few mos. back, when I ordered a bag off amazon. Something has changed in the taste..it's not near as good as when I 1st tried it. I remember the taste very well, and it was uniquely different than any other coffee I'd tried. Disappointed.., but still fairly good.	0	0
1	B001FZ0T2S	AJTR3W7GOYV0I	THE BEST!	I have a dog who until we adopted her never had oral care,so her teeth were in bad shape. We brush her teeth every 3 weeks and give her 1 booda bone weekly . Not only are her teeth cleaner but some of the staining has gone away. Our vet told us that these are the best thing for her because they digest easily and do not contain plastics.	0	0
-1	B004HOLDH4	A1Z2ZFURQGW9HF	Over priced, but tasty	I should have been more aware of the price at local stores for this product.  Walgreens had these exact almonds for $2 less/per bag that week.  They are delicious, though.	0	0
-1	B000GZEVYA	A292KQT8P22D72	Acceptable, but not outstanding	This is one of the 2 best flavorings from Torani, and I use it often in my coffee, latte, and capuccino, but it lacks a strong flavor of butterscotch that I have found in other flavorings. It is fairly good, though, and I do enjoy it in my morning coffee drink.	2	0
1	B001LQTDXM	A7DPA1XBILR50	Good Source of Fiber	When I first received my order I was a little disappointed with the barley size, they all kind of small.  But after I cooked it, the size actually doesn't matter.  I ususlly make barley soup or mix with rice.  It's good for making risotto too.  When I cook it with rice, I take 3cups of rice, 1cup of barley and use water for cooking 4cups of rice, set my rice cooker for at least 2~3 hours timer.  The taste is great and I love the texture of barley.  My kids will eat this rice mix without complain.  It gives you a lot more fiber compares with just eating rice. I keep my barley in freezer.	7	0
1	B003TW1OJ2	A2EZW502SEA2N9	Good tasting!	This a good soup.  It is a different tasting tomato soup, but good.  The price was great!  Thank You.	0	0
1	B001EO5TIE	A35OD1RKGX6RJK	Great Green Tea	I've tried many green teas in the same price range, but I always come back to Stash Organic Green.<br /><br />This green tea tastes how I think green tea should taste.  It's light, vegetal and very smooth.  To get the full flavor you need to use more leaves than most other green teas, and make sure the water temperature doesn't go over 180 degrees.  I often mix this tea with cascade mint, jasmine green or other Stash loose leaf herbal teas because although it's very good by itself, plain green tea can get boring day-after-day.  Contrary to the other reviewer, I don't like the Stash Organic Pinhead Gunpowder, and recommend this tea instead.	2	0
1	B000W5SLHW	A403TW4XYPNBW	Price increases OUCH	I love this food.  Having lost too many dogs to cancer I wanted a grain free good food for my new puppy.<br />I ordered this from WAG thru AMAZON for $18.99 just a month ago NOW it is almost $3 MORE!?! for a 5.5# bag.  C'mon!<br />I am willing to pay a bit more for a better product but this has no grain so grain prices can't be factoring in.<br />What gives?  To pay $25.50 w/ ship and tax for 5 pounds of dog food is not fair. Folks need to say something!  So..<br />why? if you please and thank you.<br />Sage<br />chrystalpaths@yahoo.com	0	0
1	B001COE2RU	A1D5QLQ0DO5CP7	my favorite	I found just enough of this product to be totally addicted. Now I can't find it anywhere, how come?<br />It was the perfect blend to add to my morning hot cereal. Please bring it back.<br />I agree that it was good in part because of NO peanuts.	0	0
-1	B005DFL4PM	A2I6FFCUE6KID9	Unimpressed	"With all the top heavy happy reviews I expected more.  This barely lasted us through 10 peanut butter sandwhiches and it was just ""eh.""  It is not over the moon mouthwatering flavor.  And for how long it lasted, not worth the price.<br /><br />IF you are only doing ONE TEASPOON at a time, than this will last you longer.  But the directions state for 2 tbsp at a time and that is about right for one serving."	1	4
1	B000LKUTN2	A20VNLGEDROP0P	The best Gluten Free Pasta you can buy	"Ancient Harvest's pasta line is about as good as it gets for store bought dry pasta. The <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000LKTBDQ"">elbows</a> and <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000LKTBA4"">shells</a> have too much corn in them and can start to dissolve into the water or sauce very easily. The rotelle, however, hold up very well and are great not only in thick sauces but as a replacement for elbows in any mac and cheese or casserole dish. The <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000LKTB90"">spaghetti</a> noodles are better than most wheat pasta brands(I'm not the one who's gluten free around here and I still use them over wheat pasta.) The <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000LKWSG8"">pagodas</a> are also good but will usually get crunchy again when they cool off.<br /><br />The bottom line is that this is the best gluten free brand out and this is the style you want if you need something other than long noodles."	1	0
1	B002QWHJOU	A30F5VJRO3095U	My Silky Terrier loves these!	He weighs 15 pounds, so he is just at the top of the range for the teenie size Greenies.  He likes them so much, he would probably prefer the Jumbo size!  I've given him these for his whole life, so I don't know if they get his teeth any cleaner than without them, but his teeth look pretty clean to me!	1	0
1	B001D9ZV5G	A2XPBTZZ4I080R	Love this product	"I have been giving these treats to my dogs for the past 3 years or so. Never upset their stomachs and every time I say a word with ""tion"" on the end they get so excited.<br />Great products, great ingredients and above all a very trustworthy company!"	0	0
1	B001EQ5A5E	AM4TW3L78B6U4	Awesome	Since my family isn't huge seafood lovers, we don't use this on seafood, we use it on chicken. It's THE BEST seasoning I have found, and love the fact that it comes in large containers because we don't skimp on it. Love, love, love it!	0	0
1	B001EPQGN0	AZI8515O64IQC	Rod Rocks makes the perfect toddy.	Wonderful, deep, nutty flavor. Aroma reminiscent of pipe tobacco (in a good way.)<br /><br />Especially nice with some honey and brandy. Rod Rocks Toddy!	0	0
1	B001PMDYXW	A2LUU9SFDSXQ44	pancreatitis cats	2 cats have pancreatitis and one of which has a chicken allergy (we think) and this is the only brand of food other than the prescription only stuff that the furballs like and is ok for them	1	0
1	B000GAUKN6	A2AUZEQ4XUFVS6	So much better than other brands!	"I can't say enough about how wonderful this product is! The pineapple chunks are so natural tasting, delicately tender, and supremely ( and yet suprisingly ) still juicy on the tongue, with just the right amount of sweetness. I've tried more than a dozen other premium brands and probably at least another dozen or more so-called ""natural"" health food store offerings, as well as several grocery store brands of dried pineapple chunks, but none, even the most expensive ones, come close to comparing to these. Simply the best!"	3	0
1	B000W7WQX0	A2DJ5R7SYQ2G4U	Brings back good memories!!	This is a great product. I can't find corn nuts around here. They are sooo great. I can't remember the manufacture from years ago, but these are very close. The only difference I note is that these are a  tad less salty, but that's o.k. we all get way too much salt.<br /><br />I will continue to purchase these lovely, crunchy, nuggets of corn!!	2	0
-1	B000EM9E2Y	A2RNYW2HIQBGSM	Terrible, don't waste your money	These are just awful.  I love all kinds of toasted cheese, but simply couldn't eat these.  Fed them to the dogs.	0	0
-1	B004YV80OE	A1ZZR25X0CNOJX	Easy Cheese-y	Our family is divided into those who like Velveeta cheese, and those that don't. I'm one of the people that likes Velveeta cheese. I used to eat it by the cube as a kid.  My spouse, on the other hand, who happens to be from Wisconsin, will rarely touch Velveeta and feels it does not qualify as an actual cheese.<br /><br />So trying this was a gamble.  Will half my family eat it?  Will the other half like it as well as other Velveeta products?<br /><br />Yes and Yes.<br /><br />The pasta packet looks like rice, but cooks up like pasta (which it is) and comes out in these cute little flat football like shapes.<br /><br />The dehydrated broccoli could hardly be called broccoli. There may have been one entire flourette, but it was all shredded up and dried.  In the heated mix, it plumps up, but again, you are getting such a small amount, it hardly contributes to the nutritional value.	0	0
1	B001EQ54UK	A26KDDAWJSS0R1	Fabulous Coffee!!	The cafeteria at my work serves this coffee along with the brand's Cinnabon and caffeine free versions.<br /><br />This coffee is fabulous!  Rich, full bodied, doesn't leave an aftertaste or acid reaction for sensitive stomachs.  Much to my surprise, the Organic blend has a smoother finish than the non-Organic blend.<br /><br />I only wish I had easier access to it in the stores.  Which is why I'm buying it here.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor, try some and see for yourself.	6	1
1	B002QWP8H0	AEGATW6NWW537	Our Doggy's All Time Favorite Treat	"We have 4 very spoiled furbabies & Greenies are their ""special"" treat.  They each get a greenie when they are groomed, brushed, bathed, etc.  Just say the word Greenie & you have a flash mob of doggies begging energeticly at your feet."	0	0
-1	B004FEN3GA	AGEKVD8JPZQMT	Yuck!	"Not a fan.  There's really nothing good about these.  They only taste a little bit like blueberry, but what really gets me is that they are more like crackers.  I saw ""newtons"" and I assumed they would be soft and cake-like.  But no, they are hard and crunchy like crackers - and they kind of taste like cardboard.  Imagine eating Wheat Thins without any flavor at all (even the plain ones have some sort of spices on them) - that's what these remind me of.  My toddler also hated them, and so did my pregnant wife.  My dogs liked 'em, though!"	2	4
1	B000LR0M00	A2OOQMIYF8XQST	Yum!	I was very happy with both the caviar and the company. The shipment arrived next day well packaged and with wonderfully reusable freezer packs. The caviar was fresh and extremely tasty. I would certainly order from them again.	11	1
1	B000EVIDUY	A3QPAY0TGGBKMV	Good Brownies	Whether you need to eat Gluten-free or not, these are great brownies.  Moist and full of flavor.  We took some to my kindergartner's graduation and the dissapeared quickly.	0	0
-1	B0019ZBV4E	A1NH2K8N77S5RY	Don't buy	"Just got back from Meijer & happend to buy one of these. To ""find"" the nutrition the label asked me to ""write"" to their place of business. Below that it says ""PRODUCT OF CHINA OR TURKEY'. Just thought it would be worth while to note though. I bought it for 1/10 of this price. Let's see here... The sticker says 5.96. They don't taste exceptionally good. I would only use them for cooking. Not worth the purchase as $6 (or $60)can get me a whole canister(s) of ""Deluxe"" mixed nuts from a name brand. Perhaps I should sell mine as ""used"". I only ate 2 nuts out of it so far and would easily settle for $20 :)"	4	0

-1	B000ETGBN2	A20HJEA1HZGJ39	well	I love me the regular Mi-Del Ginger Snaps... but out of a fluke I picked me up a gluten free bag once and thought it tasted not so yummy.  like ginger flavored sweetend hard dirt.  so unless you have to have the gluten free for some reason go get you the normal ginger snaps which as of Sep 2006, Amazon offers	0	4

-1	B002RTNBSA	A36TA71KLLS3HH	Ito En Jasmine Japanese Green Tea	"This is made in Thailand and does not taste the same. The old made in Japan drinks are totally superior in taste, after taste, aroma. Didn't listen to the other reviewer about the formula change with the made in Thailand drinks and ordered 2 cases but didn't want to go through the trouble of returning. If you had tasted the old drink, you will greatly be disappointed. If you have not had Ito En before, you may still find this drink good. Sorry, not for me.<br /><br />Update 7/14/12:<br />I saw a comment from other buyer that he/she received a Japan made batch. I went ahead and ordered 2 cases. Sure enough, they are now Made in Japan. The interesting thing is this batch tasted ""watered down"", exactly like another reviewer said!!! I now understand what he/she meant. Bottom line: there is definitely some quality consistency issue here (at least post Tsunami time). It is batch dependent, facility dependent ( have seen Thailand made, Japan Made, and have seen comments about Hawaii Made!). Good luck to all who seek good tea. I have switched to brewing my own tea and bought the tea from Eto En directly."	2	1
1	B002ZNW346	A1IC8H5EXXY4FN	Great dog food.	Our Weim loves this food.  Got much higher rating than the prescription dry food that we were getting from the vet at $60 for an 18 pound bag.  And the food is delivered to our home!  Very happy with the decision to switch to Blue Buffalo and would highly recommend!	3	0
1	B003GTR8IO	A27X7XXOKMK879	Great Starbucks Coffee at Home!	"As coffee lovers know, it is sometimes hard to get the same flavor and consistency of brand names at home.  In the case of Starbucks Natural Fusions Ground Coffee this is NOT the case.  The coffee is just as good as what you'd get at their shop (though you do have to make it yourself) with a rich and fragrant vanilla taste. Following the recipe as listed, yields a great cup of coffee (which I have not always found to be the case when I purchase brand name coffee - I often have to ""fiddle"" with the guidelines to produce something close to what I get at their restaurant/shop).  The bag came very compressed and wrinkled and I was initially worried that this would impact its taste but we've made multiple cups since opening up the bag and each has been delicious and the bag itself does the usual job of keeping the product fresh (though I doubt we'll have it for long as good as it is).  If you like Starbucks and/or vanilla coffee, this is a product for you."	0	0

1	B005HG9ESG	A3VJ27010XUWTF	Very tasty water	"I have taste electrolite infused water once before and I loved it. I have no idea what the brand name was. This tasted the same. It literally makes me want to drink more. I have been scared off from drinking tap water as I have some auto-immune diseases and now qualfy as ""older"" (I hate that tag, elderly).<br /><br />We periodically receive reports from the city about what they find in our water. It says in the report that we should stop buying water. But it also has the warning about if you have an weakened immune system, are elderly, undergoing treatment involving steriods that you may be more vulnerable to certain protoza. Cryptosporidium is one that they warn against. It has been shown to be absent for several years and a person who has a weakened immune system should recover in two weeks. But the report also says the reason that the water doesn't taste well and look OK is because of algal bloom. Algal bloom can be bad for dogs and lambs so should I still drink it? I don't trust it so I don't.<br /><br /> When I tasted this water, it tasted so much better. All I can go by is taste. It tastes clean.<br /><br />I docked the rating by one star because of the cost. I still don't think I could afford it. I tried filters for a while but the filters were so expensive. If I could afford it I would definitely sign up for the subscribe and save.<br /><br />At least until it is gone, I can enjoy the water so clean tasting that I want to drink more.<br /><br />I highly recommend this water, it is so good that it is a treat to drink."	0	0

1	B000FDDESM	A1VPK96SU7YFMP	5 stars for convenience; 4+ for product quality	Add water and butter (or oil) - that's it.  I prepped in bread machine and baked in oven.  Makes a medium size loaf.  The product is 1 lb per package.  The bread bakes up crusty on the outside, fairly soft inside, chewy, slightly sweet, with a mild 9-grain flavor (although the overall taste is pretty hearty).  Great toasted with eggs for breakfast.  For the subscribe & save price, this is a real winner, IMO.  You can purchase with confidence!	2	0
1	B001FA1LQ6	A14YGK4LQ2P5J1	Awesome coffee!  If you like flavored coffees, don't pass this one up.	"My wife's sister lives in St. Louis, and she sent us a pack of coffees from Kaldi's.  One was Cinnamon Hazelnut (good), but the best one was Kaldi's Highlander Grogg.  I like flavored coffees, but Highlander Grogg became my new all time favorite.  We soon ran out, and I turned to Amazon for more.  Unfortunately, Kaldi's Highlander Grogg is never in stock from them so I tried to find an alternative, and found Berres Brothers.  I found it just as good, and, you can't beat their price.<br /><br />If you want to really take it up a notch, I would encourage you to try the following recipe:<br />1.  Look on Amazon for a <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000E170W"">BonJour Primo Latte Frother with Stand, Black/Brushed Aluminum</a>.<br />2.  Buy International Delight creamer (we use the SUGAR FREE, made with Splenda version).  It won't work with CoffeeMate as that creamer doesn't froth for some reason.<br />3.  Pour the creamer in the cup first.<br />4.  Add any additional Splenda or other sweetener of your choice.<br />5.  Use the Primo Latte Frother to ""froth"" the creamer into a foam.<br />6.  Add coffee, and enjoy!  (of course, you can always sprinkle the froth with cinnamon, nutmeg, or pumpkin pie spice also).  You can also buy sugar free caramel and drizzle that over the top for both decoration and additional taste.<br /><br />The above is as good as any $5 latte bought at a coffee shop, and, you've saved a ton of money over the course of a year.<br /><br />We have been enjoying this for years now at our house, and we recently opened our new corporate headquarters office.  We now have the same setup at work, and our employees love it."	0	0
1	B000F1PR8E	ALJ8LNGJ8HC1V	Folgers Cappuccino addiction	My husband loves this product.  It is rich, creamy, and something he drinks all day long, every day.  When it became no longer available in our local grocery stores, I didn't know what I was going to do. Rehab perhaps?! Amazon's website came to the rescue with an amazon store that will ship us, with free shipping, a case as often as we need.  Thank you Amazon, and thank you Folgers for a wonderful product.

1	B0007A0AQM	A21ZRJE1AHHV35	Zuke's Chicken-Flavored Mini Naturals Dog Treats, 16 Ounces	My dog loves Zukes Mini Natural Treats! treats.  He expects them before he goes to sleep for the evening, and often looks for them when we just tell him he is as good boy.  When we run out of them he actually pouts because now he expects them every day.  What I like about these treats for our dog is that they are natural, no chemicals, and just the right size for our dog to chew (he is 28 lbs.).  Also, some of the proceeds go toward Cancer Research for animals, which I am all for since we lost a Jack Russell to cancer at the age of 5 (Lymphoma).  Very sad to see an animal suffer with Cancer, as with a human, and also to lose them, which is especially emotionally stressful.  We will purchase Zukes as long as our dog loves them - and we know this will be for his life.	0	0

1	B000CQG8M6	A3IPDP5UOCQ18L	Perfect Dessert Tea - Baby Bear	I'm not a coffee drinker and got tired of not having something to drink with a dessert. This tea is perfect with milk and sugar! I feel like a grown up when I drink it. Don't get me wrong I know I could just drink hot chocolate and I do but sometimes depending on what I have it with or when, hot chocolate is too sweet. Which feels hypocritical for me to say because that's how I like it, but only when it is the dessert. So this is my perfect medium. It's like a term I like to use, it's baby bear! We all know the story of Goldie Locks and the three bears. Well coffee is pappa bear's bed, too hard to get over the bitterness. Hot chocolate is mamma bear's bed, too soft or sweet for everyday. This tea is baby bear's bed, just right. Now I'm no Goldie Locks but I'd like to think of myself as that content when I drink this tea. Love it!	1	0

-1	B005K4Q4KG	AWJXWD0EMKIUV	Too sweet, too weak	Using 8 oz water as the directions state made the cocoa much too weak. It was like hot water with a few drops of chocolate syrup. Using 6 oz made the cocoa much too sweet, and still too weak in the chocolate department. It uses sucralose as a sweetener, which gives it a very intensely sweet flavor. This may not be a problem for those who like very sweet things or don't mind the taste of sucralose. Unfortunately, I'm not one of those people.	4	0

1	B000LKVL16	A3DYK1CBQ1LY2D	Yummy - even for non-vegetarians!	I've been a vegetarian for 10 years (all of my 20s) and absolutely love it!  Lately I've been really looking for good healthy protein sources that I actually like to eat, and these Primal Strips are excellent!  These things scare me because they are so realistically meat-like.<br />I've tried 3 flavors of them so far, and there was only 1 that I thought wasn't great.  It was completely edible, but the texture was just not as good as the others.  I think it was the Teriyaki that I didn't like so much, but I really liked the Texas Barbecue and the Hickory Smoked flavors.<br /><br />These are excellent low-calorie, low-fat, convenient, tasty snacks with high amounts of protein.  You can take them anywhere, keep them in your desk at work or in your purse!<br /><br />The only complaint I have about these is that I wish there were versions with lower sodium.  To me, as someone who loves a good salty snack, but knows that too much salt is not good and tries to avoid it, these taste too salty.  And 300+ mg of sodium per strip seems high.<br /><br />But in the end I am overlooking the sodium and am purchasing these in bulk now!  I just bought the Thai Peanut flavor because I love spicy foods, and I love Thai food!  I'll update this review with my thoughts on this flavor after I receive them.<br /><br />UPDATE: I received the Thai Peanut flavor and LOVE them!  They have a great chewy texture, good flavor, and a good amount of spice.  All for only 74 calories each, but 10g protein!  I definitely recommend these!	0	0

Then, decided to try it as I remember drinking ""fizzies"" many years ago and was shooting for that effect.  Sodastream does indeed add great fizz but beware the aftertaste.  I tried the orange and thought, while I was drinking it, that it was terrific.  But, then, for more than a day, I had an aftertaste like some of the diet drinks leave.  Same with the Root Beer.  And, even though the machine says add carbonation only to water and then add syrup, I decided to try adding carbonation to my own drinks, like Kool-Aid or Hawaiian Punch.  Other than being careful with the carbonation and making sure to clean the CO2 port afterward, it works very well.  However, even with my own drinks I still get the terrible aftertaste.  That part is very disappointing.  Not sure if that can even be removed.  Is it the carbonation itself?  Regular carbonated drinks do not have it."	0	0
1	B000SDKDM4	A7SDLGJH9O2DX	Very convenient	We like this coffee better than any whole beans sold by regular grocery stores.  This blend is a lighter roast, which we prefer over the darker roasts. And it is very convenient having it delivered to our house.  You have saved us many trips to gourmet coffee stores.	0	0

-1	B001P05K7W	A20QP8LVD1H5TT	Hextra chews = STAINS	this was my first time buying the hextra chews for my two dogs. they like them but i had no idea that it would leave stains on my rugs, carpet and furniture since the product description had no warning of this. i read some reviews where others didn't have this staining problem so maybe i just got a bad batch? even so, i wouldn't recommend the hextra chews just incase and would suggest getting the other version, C.E.T. Enzymatic Oral Hygiene Chews. they are just as good for the dogs teeth without the chance of staining plus are less costly. also my dogs do tend to gag on them once they've chewed the large size piece down small enough to where they think they can just swallow it whole. eventually they do spit it up and realize they need to chew it a bit more. the product and my dogs vet mentions that the C.E.T. chews are easier on digestion than other rawhide chews so i don't feel as concerned with my dogs swallowing the small pieces.	0	0

1	B000ES3LOA	A3KO62UF2XWDPS	Unbelievably Good	I have been drinking Ahmad English Breakfast just about every day for a couple years now, and had been hesitant to buy a fruit tea - I didn't want to end up stuck with 6 boxes of tea that just weren't as good. I finally broke down and got this one, and was blown away. Its delicious. I normally drink my English breakfast tea with milk and sugar (I don't like it without both), and had been searching for a tea I could drink without milk in the office (they only have half&half packets, which are not the same, and I don't want to deal with bringing in my own milk just for tea). This is it. It does not need milk. Its delicious.	0	0

1	B0040PSRJM	A3PUZHFZZB5NW8	square shapes and round shapes, food value  and good color for salads	Will be ordering several more cases of these great carrots and peas for winter and emergency; the price per can delivered by Amazon is less than the cost per can at the nearest supermarket, several miles away.  Besides, not every store in the area carries Libby's, but more expensive brands.<br />  This 15-ounce can offers about 3 1/2 servings, which each have 60 calories, no fat or cholesterol, 10 grams carb, 3 grams protein, 330 milligrams sodium, and about 160 milligrams potassium.  Also some vitamin A.  Probably there is  much more sodium in french fries...<br />It might be worth checking to see if potassium in salt substitute can be added, just a pinch, to offset what sodium there is, if it's a concern for you.<br />Ingredients on label are:  peas, water, carrots, sugar and salt.<br />  1.  Sugar _is a definite plus,  not high fructose corn syrup).<br />  2.  Carrots are a beautiful orange color and taste sweet and good; the carrots are packed on top and peas are on the bottom. Clever, on- purpose  separation has been good like this in several cans, now; you could spoon out the carrots for one recipe and use the peas for your tuna fish salad.<br />  3. Carrots aren't the usual round coin-like slices, but are small and square.  Might interest children?  square and round...<br />  4. We had these peas and carrots with pasta in salad for lunch today<br />and had sunflower-seed butter as salad dressing.  Would do it again.<br />  5.  If you cook for your pets, and this  product is new,  this might make a nice addition to what you give them.  My dog loves these and sometimes takes her dish with peas and carrots off to eat in privacy.<br /> This product is Recommended for everybody.  Enjoy.  And thanks to the manufacturer , Seneca Foods, for the thoughtfulness involved...	1	0

1	B004JRKEH4	A2GL934UT3XENH	Heat Up Your Fall!	It's no secret that I like spicy food. When I reviewed Taco Bell's Home Originals Bold & Creamy Jalapeno Sauce a little while back, I noticed two little words on the label that really got me hopeful: Home Originals. Will there be more flavors in this line?<br />Yes! Bold and Creamy Chipotle sauce is even more flavorful. Chipotle peppers are fiery chili pepper made by smoking jalapeno peppers. The smokiness adds a depth that's just hard to beat. If you like creamy hot sauces, you will love this on all those fall meals: tail gate parties, hot dogs, fries, rice and grilled veggies. It's zippy with out being overwhelming and tasty without being  tongue numbing. As always, it's great on all you Mexican food faves. I know this will be a stock item in my fridge.	0	0

1	B001GQ3E3M	AGJRZA4GW3E1H	One jar, one family, one day.	"Yes, my family, despite not being as numerous as the Duggers nor as prone to indulgence as some, still managed to finish off a jar of this stuff within 24 hours.<br /><br />To think, I was worried about ordering 6 at once (the expiry was set 21 months in the future, though the individual jars are best before 6 months after they are opened).<br /><br />The taste is heavy on the (good quality and nutty) peanut flavor, with the dark chocolate playing a present-but-secondary role.<br /><br />Things heard around my house in the 24 hours since first taste(s):<br />""Mmmmm, okay, I'll have a second spoonful!""<br />""I know I have a toothache and it's made worse with sugar, but I'll live with the pain later. GIVE ME THE JAR!""<br />""Mama, I remembered to use the potty. May I have some chocolatepeanutbutter pweeeeeeeeeease?!""<br />""Mmmm, okay, I'll stop after spoonful number 5 I promise...""<br />""Mama! IWANTMOREPEANUTBUTTER!""

1	B002AYA6M6	A33AQPJYH7UUXR	raw fed travel made easier  *BUT*....	"I have a small breed service dog and his raw food diet can be a challenge when we travel. I bought this food based on the fact that it's the closest ingredient-wise to what I'd feed him at home. He loves this food and literally spins in circles when he hears me open the container I store it in, something he has NOT done for other foods in the past.<br /><br />My issue with this food is that when I received the bag I noticed through the window on the back of the package that the lower third of the bag seemed to be mostly crumbs; in transferring the upper portion of the bag to a smaller storage container I found that most of the bottom of the bag was almost ""dust"". The ""dust"" makes my dog cough even if he eats slowly; adding a little water to his bowl has helped with this issue.<br /><br />Edited to add: I've added a photo so you can see what winds up in the bowl.<br /><br />Since this was my first bag of ZiwiPeak I'm not sure if this is normal for the brand - at this cost though I feel it shouldn't be. It could be that the product had settled and the heavy weight of the upper product caused the lower portion to settle and break, or maybe this bag just had a really rough time in shipping. Either way, this product makes traveling so much easier and my pup just loves having it at home as a treat so I've ordered a second bag today and will see if the crumb issue repeats itself or not.<br /><br />UPDATE 01/16/12: The second bag (Lamb) was received in perfect condition this time.<br /><br />Would purchase again and recommend."	3	0

It's got kind of a peanut butter consistency.  It is so delicious!  I take the whole jar and just grab a spoon and snack on it while watching tv or any other excuse I can find to eat it.  It's a great healthy and tasty snack.  I highly recommend it!

-1	B0037XARA0	A15XNT79BMHKXN	Cats LOVE the taste - but seems a little pricey for what you get	"First the good news: My cats (all 7 of them) absolutely love this food.  2 of our most finicky will eat almost nothing else, but they gobble this down.  Clearly this is a good-tasting food.<br /><br />Now the bad news: Seems very expensive for what you get.  A look at the ingredient list reveals by-products and several grain fillers such as wheat gluten that you don't usually find in a so-called ""premium"" food.  Not sure why exactly it is so expensive.  They also do not even make this available in a 5.5 or 6 oz can, only the 3 oz size - so for multiple cat households the cost of these little cans  can really add up in a hurry.<br /><br />So bottom line, it is definitely a good-tasting food and if your cats are picky eaters it is worth a try.  However, the high cost and lack of a larger can option makes this a tough sell.  I am trying to find a better/more economical food that all of my cats will like, so I can transition them off this."	8	0

-1	B001EO615Y	A2RVXEP0TELI72	NOT what i was expecting	I've had marrons glaces plenty of times before out of the country and these were a mediocre imitation at best. I figured it was too good to be true to get so much for the price - the good ones are very pricey. Instead of the delicious syrup they're supposed to have, these had that gross donut glaze. I tried to pawn these off to my little brother and his friends (they've never tried real marrons glaces) and they didn't even like these for what they are! Again, with these, you get what you pay for.	2	3
1	B002TMV3GC	A3W4D8XOGLWUN5	Hazelnut-astic	There is no question about the fact that I honestly adore a nice and simple tasting cup of coffee to start my day. But Melitta has not been a great company that produces the best coffee filters, but they've also got some really strong coffee flavors to call their own. That comes with their cafe collection, and their Hazelnut Creme Brulee. The taste is absolutely very smooth and mild to the taste buds, yet remain sophisticated and strong from the first time you simply whiff the smell and aroma. I absolutely loved the taste of it from the very first sip. I absolutely recommend this as another delightful flavor in your morning cup of joy in the morning. Melitta does do their best, and they still know how to delight anyone with coffee.<br /><br />Price: B<br /><br />Taste: B+<br /><br />Overall: B 1/2+	0	0
1	B006Q7YG56	A28WXDXJA1P0MC	My 3 dogs loved these	I have a bullmastiff, Rottweiler, and shih tzu who looooved these. Not many come in the bag so if you have big dogs they might not be worth it to spend money on, but I broke these into quarters for my shih tzu. Due to so many pet food and treat recalls over the last couple years I am wary about many things I feed my pets. These being made in the U.S. made me more comfortable than some things made in China. I will stock these for my small dog but at the price they are now I won't buy them for my large dogs.	0	0
1	B000H7G4CO	A1QT4U10DUPX2	A wonderful liquorice	I bought this yesterday at Target for I believe $2.50 for one bag. I've never seen a mango flavored liquorice before. I like it. It is a little bit harder than another Australian liquorice I bought at Target before that may have been made by the same company. That's why I'm giving 4 stars. It is a lot of liquorice for the price and imported at well. The fact that it is imported was another reason I bought it. A bag could easily be shared among two people. Flavor is light but true like eating real mango. The flavor also sticks around for a little while after you've swallowed. The total fat is 1g. The sugar is 16g. Quite a delicious and cheap snack/candy!	0	0

He really enjoys these treats, but I have to ration him -- he gags on them all the time.  I usually give him this treat when he's sitting on the back porch relaxing and chewing up a tennis ball.

1	B002AQ0OS0	A3C8OL0VMOIEL6	Bold and smooth	I agree with other review that this is a nice bold coffee but at the same time very smooth without any bitterness.<br />Similar to Americano coffee sold at well known coffee shops that sell for close to $4. This comes out to $.40 a cup! I never buy coffee in the chain stores anymore. The Keurig coffee maker eliminates the need to find a good cup of Joe. I first got a trial of how good this coffee is when I was at a doctors office and they had this coffeemaker for the patients to make themselves a cup from. I soon saw one on a shopping network and ordered it and loved it but it was the mini one so I kept that for my office and bought the nice platinum model that is fantastic. Nice hot coffee and in different size choices. I do not know how the coffee comes out perfectly regardless of the size cup chosen. I think it has to do with the amount of water released during the process. I love the machine and this blend coffee.	0	0

The texture is nice, typical biltong. The taste though is extremely oily, and extremely mild. If you like the taste of fat or oil, you're in luck. If you're looking for a strong biltong taste or healthy protein snack I'd look elsewhere.	1	0

1	B001DTKIF4	A1T6745YCNF7KM	Prompt service and good product	The product was delivered promptly in good condition and the Tomatoes are very tasty. They are great for making spaghetti sauce; much better than any american brand with the massive amounts of sodium.	1	0
1	B000Z3P9FS	APEILSU1T9T6K	PureBites Chicken Breast Dog Treats	My 3 dogs LOVE these. I have to limit them as best as I can. I think they would eat all of the treats at once if I let them. Of all of the treats I have bought them, they like these the best. The only problem with them is that some of the package has more crumbs than large pieces. I put the crumbs on top of their regular dog food which they also love. Maybe Amazon could protect the packages better for shipping. I recommend this product.	0	0
1	B000KEK6X2	A3GGD7ZWVWIKOU	Great for Ribs!!!	"This is a very tasty sauce for chicken, as should be expected. But the more amazing use of it is for ribs!! First score the ribs with a knife all over. Drench with some red or white COOKING wine. Let sit. Lightly coat with Canola oil, and dust with herbs. Then slather-on the the whole bottle of the Butter Chicken Sauce on the top of the ribs covering them completely. Put in a cooking dish in the oven at 360, and cook for two hours. The ribs are falling-off-the-bone amazing. With the perfect taste and texture, so moist and not fatty. Better than most ribs I have had ""out""."	2	0
1	B001EO5QPA	A4XQ04F3KY20W	Delicious	I've only done this tea as a cold brew iced tea. There is no bitterness, just a smooth, refreshing, green taste. The ginger is very strong. I love ginger, so that is no problem for me. A second brew was significantly weaker, so I will stick to one brew per batch of leaves with this one (I am able to get three quality brews from many green teas).	1	0

1	B001TZVI1K	A1WCRIQUX3L1AR	One of the safest on the market	Not sure where the other reviewers got their facts, but the latest consumer reports testing shows that the Tropicana apple juice has the lowest levels of arsenic and lead compared to most other juices on the market.  Just google consumer reports apple juice arsenic levels and see the results for yourself.  I prefer this juice to most others because it simply tastes the best.  The results of the testing solidify my choice.	2	1

After trying all of the coffees in the sampler, I think this is by far the best so far.  It is a nice, medium, very smooth and totally non-bitter cup of coffee.  I like it a lot, but I haven't really even started trying out the 100+ varieties available so we'll say it's the best ""so far"".  Still, a good cup of coffee."	3	0
-1	B000660MQ0	A1UAGQRQCPCMLB	Bad loose leaf tea	This is NOT a loose leaf tea.  More like tea dust.  I like Twinings just fine and like to have some standard black tea around so that if I buy a flavored tea that is too strong in flavor, I can mix with unflavored black.  The crumbs in this canister were so bad I had to go out and buy tea bags.  It cannot be used in an infuser.  It is also noticeable that the flavor is far weaker than the Irish Breakfast tea they sell in the bags.  Nearly worthless as a loose leaf tea.  Wish I hadn't purchased.	0	0

It is shocking how different this product is from the stove-top version (which is so flavorful and has a perfect texture) even though they are called the same thing, though it looks as if the ingredients differ.  The texture is goopy, the flavor is bland--it is sticky and plain.	1	1

I can not find this flavored coffee where I live. When I opened the bag,I was pleased with the aroma, but when brewed the coffee had a very bitter taste. I thought I had just added too much coffee. Next morning,I tried again using a little less coffee. It was still bitter.I have tried different amounts and every time it is BITTER.

1	B0013NUGDE	ALL9XFM0Q1N4E	A Great Alternative to Regular Chips	Popchips are really a great snack and not just an alternative to regular chips but a full on replacement as far as I'm concerned. The taste and texture are great for the Jalapeno ones. I hate greasy fried chips and often switch the baked version of any chips. Now I have another choice...POPPED! If you like flavored chips and you want something crunchy with a great taste then you owe it to your self to try a bag of Potato Popchips!	0	0

1	B000EHKWDO	ANUOUIJH5SHED	Excellent Source of Protein for Snacking	As a Certified Personal Trainer, I am always looking for products to recommend to my clients.  Of course, I would never recommend anything that I have not tried for myself FIRST.  Free range turkey jerky is an excellent choice for snacking, and Shelton's is by far the BEST TASTING! The flavor is not too spicy, but certainly not bland either.  The jerky's texture is very chewable, not leather-like.  Even my elderly clients can chew it. Being turkey, not beef, it saves you calories and fat.  It is a great source of (antibiotic-free) protein that does not make you feel bloated, so it perfect for snacking.  No need to worry about refrigeration after opening, so you can carry it in your gym bag and have the perfect post-workout protein snack.  I also recommend my clients keep it at work so they can avoid being tempted by the vending machines.  Amazon has it at a GREAT price!!	4	0

1	B007729RBC	A3AZT5F1PFC4WA	non- GMO Xylitol. Great for sugar free baking.	"Xylitol is an all natural alternative to chemical sugar free sweeteners. I love to use it when baking. Xylitol tends to be less bitter than stevia (another natural sugar substitute). This is great for any one watching their sugar intake. Many body builders use this as a natural alternative to chemical sweeteners like sucralose when trying to cut calories. Another plus, Xylitol is good for you teeth! I use it to make homemade tooth paste and mouthwash that really works. The only downside is that Xylitol can be pricey. Average cost is $7 per pound. I have only tried the Now brand, but I have also heard good things about Ideal brand Xylitol, which also offers a ""brown sugar"" version. Oh yes, and please do read labels. Toxic to animals! And, causes laxative type effects if over consumed."	0	0

The savings are substantial.  The coffee itself is always delicious!  My shipments always arrive quickly and in good condition.  Being a single mom, a full time college student, and a full time Realtor, I don't have much time for anything else.  Brewing my coffee in 50 seconds has made my tight schedule much easier to juggle.  I highly recommend buying these K-Cups from Amazon!	1	0

1	B001AYEUEW	A5884QBFBI9SK	Stubbs is The Best	First - The description is WRONG for ingredients. Stubbs does not use high fructose corn syrup in their products. They use all natural ingredients. All Stubb's products are Gluten Free. They are all amazing. We just put a pork roast in the crockpot and pour the pork marinade over it and let it cook all night. It's amazing. The prices on here are high. Walmart sells all Stubb's products for $2.50 each but if you can't find what you want I guess you have to pay these high prices. Still they are worth every penny. We also use the beef marinade all the time with beef short ribs in the crockpot and the herbal mustard rub. I use that on my tofu scramble with lots of curry powder. The mustard rub goes great with curry. The bbq sauces are great too!	1	1

1	B005V9UG18	A3LY2GBBTINSJA	Orgain	I am on medications for cancer and among the many side effects of the treatment is loss of taste and appetite with a resultant weight loss.

Since there is no lactose content it is also far more tolerable. Recommend highly.	2	0

1	B0051COPH6	ANCOMAI0I7LVG	A tasty treat for a growing baby...	My wife and I have always been of the belief that it is best to give your children food you have personally prepared and so we tried to stay away from excessively feeding them `baby food'.  We have kept food on hand for convenience especially when we're on the go.  One thing my wife and I have found is that these Baby Gourmet pouches are certainly the better `baby food' product out there.  Sure, you're talking about pears, which are rich in natural sugars and may not be the food you want your little one gobbling down, but in my eyes it is far better than many of the processed foods parents feed their children regularly.  In fact, if you glance at the list of ingredients here you'll see organic fruits and vegetables that (shocker) actually match up to the description on the front of the pouch.  My youngest still gulps these down when we're out and about as a hold me over for dinner (yeah, these really aren't `meal' worthy, but more of a snack).  They are tasty (yes, I've tried it)...you can really taste the pear.  All in all, this is a good product that I'd recommend to parents looking for a healthier alternative to their child's snacking.	0	0
-1	B002CENRLG	A1EJ2WMYHDED71	Filling but STINKY!!!	There is no doubt, these noodles filled me up...however, i'm not sure if they suppressed my appetite because they are filling, or because they smell SO bad i couldn't stomach eating them anymore.  There is something about the fluid these noodles are packed in, they have an EXTREMELY strong fish odor...even when i rinsed the noodles and boiled them for nearly 10 minutes, the smell was still there (even with some tomato sauce on them).  Seriously, the smell was horrid.  The consistency was strange too, but that i could get used too...the smell...no way.  :-(	3	2

This is a tasty tea with lots of flavor and is great with sugar and milk.<br /><br />My only complaint is that it seems it is often unavailable for order.<br />Update:  11.11.10 We have now been waiting for a month for it to be available again.

BBQ flavor is excellent too.  Although I love salt and vinegar chips, I wasn't crazy about their version.  The sour cream and onion and the cheddar were also so-so.  Out of all the flavors, original is my favorite.  You don't feel you're compromising anything with this alternative chip.  Way to go PopChips!	0	0
-1	B001E95KRE	A2DM3PME9OXWT3	small - not medium - sized treats	I'd purchased these dog treats in a local store (Medium sized) and it was a great size for my dog, my dog loved the treats and I thought that the ingredients were okay for my dog.  When I saw these on Amazon for about half of what I was paying retail, I thought it was a great deal and ordered the pack of 6.  Problem - even though the close-up of the bag image shows/lists the treat size as Medium, and I thought that I was ordering Medium, what I actually received was 6 bags of Small treats.  Of course I didn't catch that until after I opened the first bag - so no returning this item.  I'll use them but I really would have preferred to have received 6 bags of the Medium treats.  I alerted Amazon to this image problem, but more than a week later the bag image still lists/shows the treat size as Medium.	0	0

The box has changed, but it still says ""Good Earth Original Sweet & Spicy Tea and Herb Blend"" and the description of the product on Amazon says it is ""caffeine-free."" .<br /><br />I received the caffeinated tea. I then tried to return the tea, and saw that Amazon doesn't let you return grocery items. I spoke to Good Earth and they said that they would send me a label to return the tea, but that was two weeks ago and I still haven't received a label.<br /><br />I did try the tea and the worst part of this experience is that it hardly has more taste than water. Now its time to find a replacement tea (and to see whom I can convince to take this tea from me while I admit to them how tasteless I found it.)<br /><br />One more complaint, the product description on Amazon says: "" All Good Earth Teas contain absolutely no sugar, artificial flavors, colors or preservatives."" while one of the main ingredients in both the caffeinated and decaffeinated teas is ""artifical flavor."""	0	0

Well it was for the first week or so, but this industrial container is very hard to drain on your own.

I have been mixing it with hot water for about one week and the Vanilla flavor is still coming through strong.<br /><br />The most surprising thing, though, was how quickly the water drained when I was making it.

-1	B003UOX5NC	AKZKG2Z7CNV27	decent, but not as dental as I expected	"I bought this product hoping it would help keep my cats teeth clean and their breath fresh. I wish I had read the ingredients before I purchased it because it doesn't seem to have any enzymatic ingredients found in true, working dental treats. Also the only breath freshening ingredients- rosemary and chlorophyll, are at the very tail end of the ingredient list as dead last and third to last. I am glad that these ingredients are present, but they are in such small quantities, that they can't be helping much. From personal experience, I have not noticed and breath freshening results. I think the only reason why they are ""dental"" treats is because of the small amount of rosemary and chlorophyll as well as the fact that they are crunchy and not moist treats, which is very good. Another issue I have with these treats is that my cats only like this product while its very fresh. They seem to go stale really easily, like within a week, and then after that my cats don't care for it. I always close them tightly and I've even tried putting them in a separate bag- in container, but still no luck. If your looking for a real dental treat I would recommend Crunch n' Clean with DentaShield. However, this is still a MUCH better treat than Pounce brand or Meow Mix or any soft treat that can have soft sticky particles that will stay stuck to your cats teeth and smell bad and cause dental problems. This treat may not help teeth significantly, but they definitely won't hurt them and probably do some good; just not as much as I expected for the price. Also there are tuns of vitamin in these, which is pretty cool. They really are pretty decent treats, and I would probably give them 4 stars if they were just treats. However, to be marketing them as ""dental,"" they really should have enzymes or more prevalent dental ingredient."	0	0

We have used this popcorn both on the stove top and in our popcorn machine, it can't be beat!  Even better is the customer service at Discount Tommy!  They stand behind absolutely everything they sell!	3	3
1	B002DHOTOQ	A2HYHT45PHNIIG	A Favorite Treat	This is really a good snack.  I tell myself that the whole grain makes it a little better than other things I could eat.  The item still had plenty of shelf left, based on its 'best by' date, but there's no way Cheez-it's are going to remain uneaten in my household long enough to worry about that.	0	0

1	B000OIXE10	AA5KZBF1IUJEQ	Yummy	"These are better than the other brands I have tried. Most have an ingredients list along the lines of ""Pumpkin seeds, salt, (maybe some kind of oil)"" and that's it, and usually taste as bland as paper to me. I like salt, nay...I love salt. These have a nice roasted flavor, and salt you can actually taste. They are not overly salty tasting, you don't feel the salt on your fingers, and there isn't a layer of salt in the bottom of the bag like you see in a bag of pretzels. It was nice not to have to get out the salt shaker and dump some in the bag.<br /><br />I wound  up eating nearly a whole bag in one sitting. If you like nuts and seeds, and enjoy a tasty salty snack then you will most definetly like these."	0	1
1	B003GPXFQC	A3T6GI58OGUER9	The best!	I find this to be the best canned salmon I've tried. I don't like too much bone/skin-it's waste unless your dog or cat likes it. I've eaten several cans of Chicken of the Sea, and it is very meaty, little waste, and not at all 'fishy'.  Good for you, too. I like it with my cream cheese sauce.  Take half cream cheese, half mayonaise, add artificial sweetener and whip. (sweeten to your taste-I use about 6 packets splenda to a cup of sauce. YUM!	3	0
1	B0014WYXQK	AIVK8215B8911	Italian soda in a can	"Izze is like a freshly made italian soda, but with the convenience of being in a can. It's not super-sugary like a normal fruit-flavored pop and it has a lighter fizz (just the right amount, if you ask me). I tried the Pomegranate flavor, which I would describe more as a tart cherry/pomegranate blend. It has quickly become my beverage of choice when I open up the fridge. It's definitely more of a sparkling fruit juice than what you would think of as ""pop"". I highly recommend it!"	2	0
-1	B000E8WIAS	ANZ02ZWFXYB2E	YUKKK!	I had heard so much about this natural sweetener that I was anxious to try it since the artificial ones I didn't want to touch at all, especially with their awful aftertaste. I suppose if it comes down to a choice between this stuff and artificial sweeteners this stuff is better for your body. The taste absolutely turned me off! Using more doesn't make things sweeter, it only makes the taste worse. Since I only use sugar in my coffee which I drink without anything else added, I find no sugar, just black is better than this!	3	0

1	B001EQ5J0K	A1PB97BLMR9X2S	Very Easy to Make and Very Tasty Too!	This is a great product.  I made the potato cakes for breakfast.  Just add water to the mix.  The potato cakes were ready to fry up in just a couple of minutes.  I slapped them down on the griddle with a bit of olive oil.  They browned up very nicely and were just crispy enough.  One little package made 6 nice sized potato cakes.  I only used 2 of them so I just put the others in individual sandwich bags and put them in the freezer.  I figure I'll take out a couple more next weekend and heat them up on the griddle while the eggs and bacon are cooking.  These potato pancakes have a great texture and they stayed together well.  I am so glad I made this purchase because these potato cakes taste much better than the frozen potato hasbrown type potatoes.	1	0
-1	B001GVIR9S	ANMA1H8LGEVBF	Wanted them to taste more peanut buttery (and another 1/2 star to make it 3 1/2)	Ok, I picked these up at my local Trader Joe's...they're not bad, but I have three issues that would cause me to pass these by next time:<br /><br />1. they just don't have enough of a peanut buttery taste. They're more like buttery corn muffins with a hint of peanut butter flavor. I do like that they are not overly sweetened, but it needs a bit more peanut butter flavor.<br /><br />2. The cereal isn't stale, but I like the way another reviewer stated the texture/crunch, sort of like a crouton that is just starting to go stale....<br /><br />3. The puffs are way too big. I can just about get only two or three in my mouth and milk is drooling out all over the place. But just putting one on a spoon isn't enough (I know, picky...).  Oh, and get ready for the scrappage of skin from the roof of your mouth. It's like sandpaper.  So I'm eating these now as a snack without the milk and spoon.  Not bad.<br /><br />So that sums it up.  I'm eating the cereal and enjoying it (albeit the last three comments), but next time, I'll pass. Might pick them up again if they go on sale, but I would be using it more as a healthy snack and not a cereal.	0	1
-1	B0015V8EOW	A1K3QZVWSQY3RS	Cute Licorish, TERRIBLE taste	The coins are hard, they take a day and a half to chew, and there is no anise flavor in this licorice at all.

This is a great candy idea, but the flavor and texture need a lot of improvement.	0	1

1	B004TPKAN4	A3SYE6NEO8VSU0	"""Newman's Own Organics Ginger Snaps"""	"I was eager to try Newman's Own Organics Ginger Snap.  As always, I checked the label first and was pleased.  The serving size of these small (6 gram) cookies is five (30g).  The 6.5 oz package contains about 6 servings.  It is made with 70% + organic ingredients including organic unbleached wheat flour, organic sugar, molasses, organic palm fruit oil, and ground ginger, this product qualifies as ""organic."" Ginger Snap cookies do not contain artificial flavors, colors, hydrogenated oils, or trans fat.  The recipe contains wheat, soy ingredients and monocalcium phosphate.<br /><br />Nutritionally, Ginger Snap is relatively low per serving in fat (3.5g), saturated fat (1.5g) and average in calories (130).  Per serving of sodium (180mg) and total carbohydrates (24g) are acceptable, but nothing to write home about. Ginger Snap are processed on equipment that may also process products containing peanuts, tree nuts and dairy. I sampled two cookies and found them to be delicious.  Caution:  It is difficult to limit yourself to just one serving.  They taste that good."	0	0
-1	B003THML30	A25NKS3M15FM91	Decent granola bar, but the packaging is a bit misleading	"When I first opened the box I was surprised to find 5 packages of granola bars, each with 2 bars each, so a ""10-pack"" has 5 packages with 2 granola bars in each package (I never noticed it was normal to do that with granola bars), hence the serving size is 2 bars. The price for each packet is about the same as that of a normal clif bar, so I don't know if it's really worth it to me. You get about 60% more mass with a clif bar than with this for the same price.<br /><br />That being said, they taste decent and taste good broken into pieces with peanut butter and nutella."	0	0

1	B003Z4F56C	A3RZ9HLZL37JW5	Zero Weight Watchers Points Plus points!	These noodles are great! I use them for everything, including with spaghetti sauce. If you are trying to lose/maintain weight and are missing your pasta, this is for you. They are best with other toppings, sauces, stir frys, etc. because they take on the flavor of what you are cooking with. I sauteed spinach with 1/4 tsp of olive oil and garlic and the juices from the spinach mixed with the noodles - it was delicious. I am going to use them instead of egg noodles when I make beef stroganoff later this week. I agree with the review that these are probably best in Asian recipes but they can be used anywhere you would normally use a noodle or rice. These are ZERO weight watchers points. My plate of spaghetti tonight was 4 points instead of 14 points. How can you NOT have this as part of your diet? And I agree with the other reviewer - the fishy smell goes away once you rinse and flash fry. I buy this stuff by the case.	25	0
1	B0030VJ818	A3MIRVEF9KCT3T	Most convenient way to feed a baby ever!	I love these little food packs.  I squeeze the puree directly onto a spoon and feed my baby, and that way no dishes get dirty other than the spoon.  He loves these purees, he'll eat any flavor and they seem quite natural and healthy.  As he gets older he can even suck directly out of the pouch, though sometimes he squeezes too hard and makes a little mess if I let him hold it himself.  They are also super portable and conveniently stored.	0	0
1	B0000TA3B2	A2GRUF5KO936RV	Excellent	This is one of the last of the Original mincemeats available suitable for Tarts, and real pies. The U.S. Brands have gone to half mincemeat, half apples, which is O. K. for Apple Pies, but lousy for Mincemeat Tarts. Due scarcity, it is expensive, but necessary for real English Tarts. The Tart Pans are also extremely difficult to find since Williams-Sonoma discontinued them 15 years ago, They are available on a very few sites in England. The 29 oz. Jars go a long way.	7	0

I haven't been able to find it in the local stores recently, so that is why I ordered it from Amazon.  It's called Salt-Free 17 because it jazzes up the dish so you don't have to use salt and pepper. It is also great added to melted butter and served on a saucer for dipping bread. All the ingredients (except for citric acid and corn starch) are chopped herbs, veggies, lemon peel, orange peel, and toasted sesame seeds. It has NO MSG.	4	0

I actually bought a few different varieties of Food Should Taste Good chips because I haven't seen them before and they seemed different than other chips.  I'm trying to eat healthier, but not give up all the things I enjoy eating and chips are one of those things.  This particular chip is a great alternative to the normally greesy fried potato chips and they taste just like sweet potatoes.  Apparently they are a combination of sweet potato and corn, but its still good.  Highly recommended as a snacking alternative to regular chips.	2	0

1	B001LG940E	A353U0L2HAMSHV	The Switch vs. Soda	"The Switch bills itself as ""great tasting healthy alternative to soda"" so I decided to see for myself. The first thing I wanted to do was compare it's nutritional facts against another black cherry soda that I drink and this is how they matched up:<br /><br />The Switch Black Cherry (Per Serving)<br />15.7 Calories<br />1.8 mg Sodium<br />4.2 g Carb<br />4.0 g Sugar<br />100% RDA Vitamin C<br /><br />National Brand Black Cherry Soda (Per Serving)<br />14.2 Calories<br />3.3 mg Sodium<br />3.7 g Carb<br />3.4 g Sugar<br /><br />Besides less sodium, the addition of vitamins and no added sugars, The Switch Black Cherry didn't really stand out as a winner based on nutritional facts alone. So when it came to drinking it I was hoping for a nice flavor with this one and I got it.  Even with the main two juices used in this drink being Apple and Grape, the cherry flavor came through very well.  Much better than the Orange Tangerine version.<br /><br />Overall when comparing the two beverages although I was not impressed with the nutritional facts, the taste of <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001LG940E"">The Switch Black Cherry, 8.3 Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a> was preferred! The only complaint would be the obvious price difference ($.03 per ounce vs. $.11 per ounce), but I could see buying this as a treat to have around in addition to other sodas."	0	2

1	B000GAZPWM	A2R6RA8FRBS608	whoo-hoo !!!	"Mariani makes some pretty terrific, delicious dried fruit. If you like pineapple, mango, papaya--or all of the above--then this great snack is for you! The small plastic bag comes well sealed for you to take it on the road with you when you're traveling and want a quick energy boost; and the contents remain fresh until the expiration date printed on the package.<br /><br />The dried fruit has no fat nor does it have cholesterol. The sodium content is low but you do have to watch out for the sugar--30 grams of it per serving, and there are four servings in this tiny six ounce package. If sugar is a health concern for you I would avoid eating this snack.<br /><br />Otherwise, this is fantastically tasty and very pleasant. There is also a slight ""sweet and sour"" effect from the rather sweet pineapple and the tangy mango dried bits of fruit. The papaya is also very sweet.<br /><br />I highly recommend this fine dried fruit to anyone who wants a snack food or something they can eat fast when they're on the run and they just want a little energy sugar boost. It's also nice to serve to guests as well.<br /><br />Enjoy!"	2	0
1	B001BM8SS2	A3NHUQ33CFH3VM	Find out what your baby likes. The subscription price is fair	The Vegetable Variety Pack provides an opportunity to find out what your baby likes.<br /><br />We have twin 7-month olds and their favorite is the sweet potato followed by the carrot jars.  They love those.  They like the winter squash.  We could not get either of them to eat the peas with brown rice despite numerous attempts.<br /><br />They like the brown rice cereal we give them though, which we get from the same brand, Earth's Best. They really dislike the peas and will not eat that one.<br /><br />You can get this variety pack at the subscription price, which when considering free shipping is fair enough.<br /><br />You can also get any of these flavor types individually in packs of 12 for the same price and with the same subscription arrangement.  You can even get lentils with brown rice under the same terms, so scroll and see all the types of jars they have.  Therefore, once you know what your baby likes and will eat, you'll know which subscriptions, if any, to sign up for.<br /><br />For us it makes sense to go with subscriptions since we're buying for 2 babies.	21	1

1	B001TLY7BM	A3AHPHSLJJ30A1	Wonderful Grain Free Cat Food - A hit with my 4 kitties!	I cannot find this product in Maine (in my area) and when I discovered that I could get it at Amazon with Free Super Saver Shipping, I pounced on the deal! Great prices on quality food and now both I and my family of cats are very well pleased! I searched for grain free due to my diabetic cat's dietary needs but he turned his nose up at any other brand I brought home.<br /><br />My cats prefer the Fish Flavors in Gravy, and rarely do they leave any on the plate like they used to with Fancy Feast. I'm sure the other flavors are great too but my cats just don't like them.	1	0

1	B0014DZGUQ	A23V0CBCX7AB3Z	Excellent service and an even better product	To begin with I am a vegetarian and do not have eggs. My review will be in 2 parts<br /><br />1. For the seller: When I received my first package, it was damaged and the product spilled. On raising a complaint I was promptly provided a replacement and the overall service was courteous. Full marks to VitaCost<br /><br />2. For the product: Ener-G Egg Replacer is a blessing for all those who don't eat or bake eggs. I have already used it for chocolate cookies and cake and the results are far superior than anything else I have used so far. Definitely recommend this product.	13	0
-1	B0018CIP6K	A13SHTG37MDOP7	Golden Retriever/Lab mix won't touch it, likes other formulas	I feed my dog several Taste of the Wild formulas (lamb, bison & venison, wild fowl).  He likes them all except he won't touch the Pacific Stream salmon mix.  If I put one scoop of each formula in four different bowls, the food in three of the bowls will disappear quickly, but the salmon formula just sits there.  The lamb formula appears to be the favorite, followed by bison, then fowl.  Dog is a little over 1 year old, golden retriever/lab mix.  He will gladly eat actual salmon, but not this salmon dog food.	0	0

-1	B001HTGAUM	A1AFOZHYYYYYH0	I Eat Three Every Day to Help Keep Me Strong	Great product off the shelf - healthy and tasty.<br /><br />Bad product when shipped through amazon, so far.<br /><br />Both times i've ordered this, the bars come melty and deformed.  Normally i could care less, but the the melted syrup sinks to the bottom of the wrapper and makes the whole thing a sticky mess. So a snack-on-the-go turns into where-is-the-nearest-sink so i can wash my hands.<br /><br />I can only guess why the product ships like this. This has happened twice now, so it's not a fluke, but both times it's been 100+ degree weather.  UPS or whatever company that is shipping this stuff apparently doesn't use refrigerated cabins (not criticizing, just a likely reality), so even if you refrigerate them after they show up at your door, it's too late, as they are already deformed with the melty syrup already pooled at the bottom of the wrapper.<br /><br />Even so, I'm going to order it again in the Fall/Winter months to see if the product holds up better.  If it does, i have a feeling we can chalk it up to weather, and i would just avoid ordering this through Amazon during summer months.  Either way, I'll update this review.	0	0
1	B000G1CPZQ	AYAE9YNH4RTB0	Best vegan organic canned healthy chili... and there aren't many good ones...	I had this for lunch one day with some spicy potato chips. I only ate half the can and I was completely satisfied. Usually, I eat the whole can, but this was so hearty, I didn't even need to go back for seconds! Two cans of this and some corn bread could easily feed a family of four. I have a recipe for chili pie that I might use this for. This is easily my favorite canned chili, as the healthfulness more than makes up for the little extra you pay compared to the cheaper meat chilis.<br />My only gripe, and this was all but forgotten by the time I got to the bottom of the bowl, was the odd sweetness it had that isn't present in any other canned OR homemade chili I have ever had. It put me off when I was first heating it up, but I quickly adjusted to it and I swear, I wanted to lick the bowl when I was done. I just took it as the natural flavor chili acquires without meat and when it is subtly seasoned so as not to overpower the natural sweet acidity of the tomatoes and veggies. It kind of reminded me a tvp sloppy joe recipe I made in the crock pot, once. It wasn't QUITE that sweet, but the flavor was approaching that. Very tasy anyway, but if the idea of a slightly sweeter chili puts you off, definitely try this first before ordering a whole case. Otherwise, go nuts. You won't regret it. I wouldn't buy any other...	1	0
-1	B000084ETV	A2TAB0IGORUYIW	Formula changes causing upset	I have a rescued greyhound and he was doing great on Canidae until we got our last order just last month.  Now he's a mess digestively.  I'm on an email discussion group for greyhounds and have seen lots of complaints as well as confirmation that the formula has changed.  Definitely not working for my dog anymore.  Also be aware that these used to be 40 lb. bags for the same price they now sell a 35 lb. bag for.  I know everyone's hurting financially, but I think in this case the dogs got sold down the river for a few bucks.  Disappointing.	0	0

1	B002DLXXHG	A2H5YZTNVH6Y39	Pretty Good, but not Perfect	"I bought this out of curiosity and out of the fact that I was just craving some jerky. The original flavor has a mild peppery taste to it and it's really tasty. It's mostly tender, but there are some strips of meat that have beef tendons, making the strips really hard to chew. Yes, there does seem to be some sort of ""grit"" in the beef jerky, but I'm not really too bothered by it. The other thing I don't like about this is that there are sometimes (just sometimes) strips of meat that have no flavor. But overall, I think this was a pretty good buy. I might buy it again, but only after I try some other brands."	2	0

I like that they are all natural, too.  I don't feel guilty indulging with these.  They are great to take along to the office, for lunch or snacks, or on the road, and, considering their size, they are really quite filling and satisfying! They are, of course, a little pricey, but, buying them by the case from Amazon (especially if you use Subscribe and Save) makes them less expensive than they are at the local health food store. Excellent!	0	0

I was looking for a healthy yet flavorful snack that won't break the budget and I decided to try this Kind bar stuff. Boy was I blown away by its freshness and rich flavors. I started with the coconut almond. So yummy and filling. A perfect way to grab a quick bite when you're on the go and without sacrificing health or flavor. Highly recommended!	0	0

I first bought a box at Fox and Obel, a fantastic gourmet market in downtown Chicago.

1	B000VDN1AM	A21EF5RAKR8SDY	Tulsi tea is the best tea!	"Organic India Tulsi tea is, to me, the absolute best tea I've ever had...both in terms of taste and effects. I have tried several types and have found that I enjoy Chai Masala and India breakfast the most (I enjoy them separately, but also, 1 bag of India breakfast and 1 of bag of Chai Masala makes a perfect iced chai.)<br /><br />Black tea will give most anyone an energy boost, but Tulsi tea is unique to me in that it truly does (as the manufacturers claim) leave one feeling both energized and relaxed (perhaps ""centered"" or ""focused"" would be the best word). Tack onto that the purported health benefits of tulsi, and you've got yourself one fantastic tea!<br /><br />There are a number of non-tulsi teas I enjoy, but Organic India's Tulsi Tea is the only tea I purchase on a consistent basis and that I always have on hand. Also, it is the one type of tea I am frequently recommending to friends and family. Give it a try!"	0	0
1	B000LKV04E	A15AX7PWR2HZE7	My Favorite Chocolate	"Dagoba (pronounced duh GO buh) Dark is the best chocolate I've ever tried.<br />A previous reviewer said they threw this chocolate out because of it's ""artificial taste"". Some people are so used to Tootsie Rolls and Ho-Ho's that they honestly have no idea what chocolate tastes like.<br />As my gramma used to say, ""there's no accounting for taste.""<br />Dagoba is chocolate. Pure, organic, fairly traded, and delicious chocolate.<br />I used this to make brownies (per Cook's Illustrated's suggestion) because mine always seemed to lack deep flavor. Dagoba fixed that. Try making one batch with the cheapest semisweet chocolate at the store (Nestle or Hershey's or whatever) and one batch with Dagoba Dark. Then serve them to your friends and see which they prefer. It makes an obvious and remarkable difference.<br /><br />And for plain old eating, it's equally tasty. I've tried just about every plain dark chocolate bar at the fancy grocery store and I can't find any I like better than Dagoba Dark. Some that cost the same or even more are terrible. Some are almost as good, but none are better. Dagoba Dark is expensive, but it's a good value. There are a ton of chocolates that the real aficionadoes like even better that but the prices on those ultra premium brands like Amedei and Michel Cluizel are insane - $14.50 for 1.8 ounces! Can you believe that nonsense?<br />For $2.50 a bar, if you like flavorful chocolate, I don't think you can go wrong with Dagoba Dark.<br />The ONLY thing I'm not pleased about is that Dagoba is now just another division of a mega-corp (Hershey's) so you never know when they'll try to save a penny by compromising quality or organic or fair trade principles."	1	0
1	B0016PC4TS	A2POYXTGSPSW7O	Seems to work O.K.	I received this product through Amazon Vine.  The product was placed in two areas.  The first was around a small garden to keep out some rabbits & small rodents.  It seems to have accomplished this mission but it was put down so thickly that mere pepper would have done as well.  The second use was put around a mail box.  While this product isn't a mole repellant it seems to work.  So, this product does work as advertised.  Generally, I use another product.  This product is a natural repellant & has a rather nasty order so it should not be used next to a house.  That is why it cost a star.	0	0

I like mixing it with lemon juice and honey - it gets to be simply divine!<br />I like using my big mug and have to put 2 tea bags to get the right flavor.

1	B0049YK1W0	A2W1A5GK4A03ZT	Great Organic Flour!!	This flour is phenomenal!  I purchased this variety as well as the oat bread flour and the seven grain bread flour.  I have had no problem with any of them that were not  baker related.  I followed previous advice from another review and divided the 25 lb bag into 5lb gallon freezer bags and it works great.  Make sure you do that with any flour you won't use in a few weeks to a month because the fat in whole grains can go rancid and and make your flour taste funny.  I make sandwich loaves (13x4x4) with pan de mie loaf pans for my children and this flour comes through every time!  The wheat in particular is very smooth and makes a great textured bread and my children have never complained like they did with store bought wheat bread.  I very often combine wheat with either the seven grain or the oat for a little texture, depending on what flavor of bread I'm making.  This was the best purchase I put on subscribe and save.  I jumped right in and purchased a 25lb bag my first try and it has worked for my family but if you are skeptical, try a smaller bag, I don't think you'll be disappointed.	1	0
1	B001465RXE	A1UQBFCERIP7VJ	Stash Chamomile Herbal Tea	Stash Chamomile Herbal Tea is tea bags with dried, crushed chamomile flowers.<br /><br />Honestly, as far as I'm concerned, chamomile is chamomile.  I suppose that when you use loose flowers you get sediment in the cup and I have seen this happen with some brands of chamomile tea bags, these don't do that.<br /><br />I have also had organic chamomile (this isn't) but I can't taste the difference.<br /><br />Each bag is individually packaged and that is either good or bad depending on how and where you use it and if you are concerned about excessive packaging.<br /><br />If you like chamomile tea, this is a good choice.	0	0

1	B0027E2M7Q	A2OTK102H8Z63B	Great for cats!	"It stinks, it's sticky-gooey-awful, and my cat loves it!<br /><br />My vet recommended ""baby food"" for my cat when he was having trouble digesting his normal fare.  I tried several varieties but Gerber Beef & Gravy was the clear winner.  My cat likes it so much that he insists on a jar of it to start each day.<br /><br />More expensive than ""cat food"", it beats the heck out of having to deal with kitty vomit!  Since Gerber doesn't vitaminize its foods for cats, I add 50-100mg of Taurine to every plate.<br /><br />Amazon's prices are the best!"	4	1
-1	B000KFU13Q	A2NL8MDY1N7LZY	If you like licorice you will hate this.	Flavorless black jujubee- all filler no flavor. Barely discernible licorice taste in a starchy semi-hard gel that doesn't really chew - After the first bite the candy tube collapses and it just fragments into smaller gel bits. It's like they made the candy for someone who doesn't like the taste of licorice- and I bought five lbs. of this waste.  Stupid me. Hope you licorice lovers don't get burnt. Good luck.	10	0
1	B001QY03TC	A3CXMZOCKGVCQM	Like Fudge	Smells and tastes like freshly baked white chocolate fudge. One thing to be aware of is that the tea bags are unevenly flavored. Some of them taste very strong and some rather weak while most of them are in between.	12	0

Makes me think that the positive reviews are by the company itself! I'll not be buying them again. If I could give them a zero, I would. Had to throw the whole box out after the first taste. My husband and son both agreed.	0	0

-1	B001BCXTGS	A1J75JJ0Q2OEJN	It's OK for some cats... But not all.	"Of my three cats, only one likes this food. I suspect the problem is that there are actual chunks of carrot in the food, and most cats aren't fond of carrots blocking the smell of the chicken in their meal. While the ingredients list is admirable, the chunks of chicken are very appetizing-looking, and it does appear to be as advertised- All natural- it's also not very popular in my household.<br /><br />The Chicken Pot Pie flavor is especially disliked by my cats, as it's very watery. The label describes this as a sauce, but it's really more like a weak broth that apparently tastes more like carrots than chicken, because even my chicken-mooching cat will not consume it. The Sesame Chicken flavor is a little more interesting to him, but he still just picks out the bigger chunks of chicken when he's really desperate, and leaves the carrots behind.<br /><br />Honestly, I really can't believe any cat would eat those carrots!<br /><br />My suggestion is to try before you commit to this size of a package, because cats' tastes vary, and in my experience, 2 out of 3 cats will only eat it if they're very, very hungry. The third is the kind of cat that will eat anything, and so she'll dig in. If you have a cat that will eat anything, then you might have some luck with this food. If your cats are a bit more picky about their food, then you may want to hold back and see if you can dig up a single can before buying a 24-pack like this.<br /><br />I respect what the company is trying to do with their food, but I really question the person who decided they were going to put chunks of vegetables in a cat food. Cats are carnivores, and sticking a carrot in their bowl is kind of an insult to them.<br /><br />...And we all know that insulting a cat when it comes to food is one of the greatest sins against cat pride one can commit.<br /><br />Remove the carrots, thicken the ""sauce"" and you might have something here."	0	0

1	B001945N2G	ASQ7OEET37OZQ	Nothing that can't be fixed.	Perhaps it's because I live in northern Canada (although that shouldn't be an excuse), but it took a few days for the product to be shipped.  Once, however, it was, it arrive on the last day of the projected delivery day.<br /><br />No complaints.	0	19
-1	B0041CIR62	A36TDLV6OK3RO3	Hard to Understand	The instructions on this package were atrocious.  They didn't make sense, and I couldn't figure out how much water to use.  Needless to say, they didn't turn out well.  I suspect the product itself is decent, but I would need better directions or many more packages with which to experiment, to determine that for certain.	1	0
1	B002C52WIO	A1KX9LI4I9LU8H	Excellent chips!	Love these chips.  Good for a quick snack and I don't fee TOO guilty eating them since they have less fat and salt than regular chips.  Highly recommended.	1	1

1	B0025ULYKI	A1IQB5BF5VKT0H	These are soooo good!!	These chips are really good. They taste better than other name brands. They're cheaper too!!  They aren't too salty like other brands. The flavors blend really well. Just the right amount of sour cream and onion flavor with a little salt mixed in. Once I start eating them, it's hard to stop!! LOL<br /><br />I will definitely be buying these potato chips rather than another name brand. Not sure if I can state the name brand or not. :)	0	0
1	B004HOLD60	A2UMCGRN8YOU5Q	Great Low Carb snack to go!!	Before we switched to eating low carb, we used to LOVE a nice big bag of chips.  I was missing those zesty salty crunchy snacks, until we found these delicious almonds!  I have tried all of the flavors and love them all, but these are my current favorite.  I like the snack size packs as a reminder that I have had enough since I can never stop eating them (just like potato chips, no one can eat just one).  A whole package is only  8 grams of carbs (only 4 grams of net carbs if you are an Atkins dieter).  These almonds have a nice crisp texture (even better if you put them in the refrigerator for a bit) and the seasoning is evenly distributed.  Not to strong, but also not too weak that it gets lost on the almonds. A package of 12 only lasted about a week in our home, back to order more.	0	0
1	B001HBBQIQ	A1B7KOKYA2YGWR	Wellness CORE Ocean Recipe	I got this at a great price and fast free shipping.

1	B000LKXQCS	AHBAPWRL8KJZF	Addictive and Actually Gluten Free (despite label)...	This stuff is like crack.  There's no other way of describing just how delicious it is.  If it gets old, it gets a little hard, but they never sit around long enough to get old at my house.  I order this constantly and sometimes they run out, which leaves me craving it and miserable-- or begging my local health food store to dig in their back room for stray bags.  It's THAT good!!!  The only catch on Amazon is it's ingredients list wheat (in the soy sauce) as an ingredient, but the kind I've been getting are also labeled gluten free on the front.  I'm fairly confident it's a typographical error, because I've been eating it for a year now and no gluten reaction!  Enjoy!!!	0	0
1	B001EPQGVM	A1GVSHS0LZCZR7	Delicious!	Delicious tea! Does NOT get bitter, no matter how long you let it steep. Chocolate flavor is subtle but becomes much more evident when tea is sweetened. Overall, wonderful strength and flavor!	1	0
1	B005IVX11Q	A22D50TUVWJ5CQ	XO Baking Co. products	I have purchased many gluten free baking products, but XO products are by far the best.  They have no after taste and really tastes like regular cornbread, cookies, brownies, or whatever mix you are using.  I made the brownies for my grandkids, and they loved them.  Easy to follow baking instructions.  I made the corn bread for company dinner, and they had no idea it was gluten free until I told them.  When is Amazon going to start actually selling this product so I can purchase online instead of going to the store.  Cannot wait for that to happen.	1	0
1	B001J9QBU4	A2HEFKR3769OMM	I Like These A Lot	For a long time I thought I just didn't like coffee.  Turns out that I just don't like the stuff that my mom bought.  I don't know what she used to buy for the old coffee maker, but now she likes the Donut Shop K-Cups.  I can't stand that stuff without drowning it with vanilla creamer.  It's just too bitter.  The Nantucket Blend is a lot smoother.  Although the Dark Magic blend by Green Mountain is. . . interesting, of the coffees I've sampled, I prefer the Nantucket Blend.	0	0
-1	B0002DK60E	A20OEJQZSHZI37	Not quite worth it	When I first saw this in the store I thought it was a great idea and a possible time saver, even at the higher price than other traditional litter boxes. The extra money would be worth the time saving. When I brought it home and started to use it I was disappointed.<br /><br />First, the grate holes in the sifting screen are too large and so much of the smaller clumps fall through you have to scoop anyway. The clumps that fall through are so small that they fall through a regular hand-held scoop as well, I had to find a strainer that would work.  Also, the grate gets easily clogged and you have to clear it out.  The other thing that I find really annoying is that the lid system does not seal well so litter was falling out the back as my cat tossed litter around in the box.  This added a chore that I never had before, cleaning in back of the litter box.<br /><br />All in all I don't think this product has saved me any time or made the job of cleaning out the box any easier.  It actually created more work. I will replace it with a traditional litter box and send this one to the recycling bin.  I really would not recommend it.	10	1

-1	B002GWSAKM	A26CEJL5AR4U3B	Irritant	This milk tastes good, but contains carageenan which is a cellular irritant.  Carageenan is suspected to be implicated in colon cancer, and possibly other cancers since it irritates other than GI tissue.<br /><br />The same company has a carageenan-free version, called Rice Dream, Original, Classic.  It's a great alternative to this one.  Not quite as thick, but otherwise tastes the same.	1	0
1	B000MK6AX4	A10N9J678ZT2KZ	Excellent!	Purchased this as a gift for my girlfriend and we have been very impressed with the quality of the cheeses we received. We usually grab some wine and cheese on a fairly regular basis from restaurants or specialty stores so when I saw this online I figured it would be a great gift to try. It certainly opened our eyes to some varieties we had not tried in the past that we were both really pleased with. Overall it was a great gift and value!	8	0
-1	B008JKTTUA	A1S3DVQDJRRFEG	I won't order this one again	I'm a HUGE fan of Kind bars in general and have tried several varieties. I chose the almond cashew with flax + Omega-3 this time because it was more price friendly than the others. I should have known that you get what you pay for. This was the most unsatisfying Kind bar I've ever had. It's dry and lacks taste. Now I'm stuck with a whole box.	1	1

1	B000WO434S	AI1ERPR3TC35D	Delicious aroma, Very concentrated	I use this product in a commercial kitchen and bakery.  It has an incredibly fresh and clean orange scent, with no bitterness or alcohol scent.  It is quite concentrated, and I've found that you can use about half of what a recipe calls for.<br /><br />I also add about 1/4 teaspoon per cup of orange juice required in a recipe to give the finished product extra orange flavor.  This product contributes nicely to the overall smell and taste of a finished product.	5	0
-1	B0000V8HTU	A1G7ZBROZ83Z7W	no quality consistency	The first time I ordered this it was heavenly.  The beans were dark brown and oily, smell divine, and the brew was caramely, smooth and perfect!<br />So, I splurged and ordered another bag and claimed that it would be my weekend coffee.<br />I was greatly disappointed with my Saturday morning brew.  The second bag, the beans were light tan, and lacked that oily sheen, and smelled slightly bitter.  The brew was lacking depth, and slightly bitter, not much better than a grocery store medium colombian roast.  Now, I don't even want to brew it.<br />The product is too pricey to risk product consistency and I will not purchase it again.	0	1
1	B003BJOORW	A966L65JSN8XN	Only food my cats can agree on	"This is the only flavor of Science Diet (or any other brand) they will all eat without complaint. I don't know what I'll do if they stop making it. I have 3 cats, two Maine Coons who get hairballs, and this stuff really works to prevent that. As long as they eat some of it daily no more hairballs on the floor. It's a great product. I hope they never try to ""improve"" the recipe or change it in any way, or my cats will probably reject it as they have so many others! If it ain't broke please don't fix it, Science Diet! It's a winner as is."	0	0

-1	B002RSVOLM	A14638TGYH7GD9	Relatively healthy caffeine delivery system	If someone tells you they drink this because they like the taste, they may not be telling the truth. I shared these with quite a few people, and the taste was never one of the good things people said about it. That doesn't mean that there aren't any good things about it, though.<br /><br />It contains some vitamins and minerals. A test at a university found that volunteers saw some improvements in body composition. It claims to burn 100 calories per can, and who can say it doesn't?<br /><br />It assures us that it works best (in its claims to increase muscle and lessen fat) with diet and exercise, and I'm sure that's true. None of the guinea pigs in my house noticed any effects, positive or negative, though we drank it before exercise as instructed.<br /><br />Here's what it does for sure: it gives you a kick of caffeine. If you prefer a sweet, cold drink to coffee or tea, then this is probably better for you than colas. If you start or end your day with a doughnut and coffee to get the caffeine/sweets combo, then this could be a more wholesome choice. And if you believe in it enough, it could encourage you to work out harder or longer, because faith can do wonders, and there are benefits to increasing exercise.	3	0
1	B001D0DMME	A3V9OU9EJJH2W6	Tasty, but like others better	This is a tasty bar, but as it contains chocolate it isn't great for all occasions, like a breakfast snack, and to me isn't chocolatey enough to satisfy those type of dessert cravings.<br />It's still WAY better than other healthy chocolate fruit/nut bars.	0	0

1	B000IBODHC	A3D6TFYRMIV3ZL	A gift from the Goddess of Mercy.	"Like the famously smoky Lapsang Souchong, Oolong tea comes from mist-enshrouded Wuyi Mountains in the northwestern corner of China's Fujian Province (north of Guangdong [Canton] Province), whose greatest tourist draw besides its mountains is its coast line on the Taiwan Straits, and where tea has been grown at least since the Sung Dynasty (AD 960 - 1279).<br /><br />In terms of production, Oolong tea takes a middle position between the fully fermented black teas (Darjeeling, Assam, Ceylon, Kenya, Lapsang Souchong, etc.) and the unfermented green teas (Sencha, Maccha, Gyokuro, Hougicha/Hojicha, Gunpowder Green), in that it is part-fermented or ""brown"" tea. Its long, dark leaves' fermentation is stopped when they are about 30% red and 70% green, after which they are rubbed to promote their aroma and texture and then dried over charcoal.<br /><br />Ti Quan (Kuan) Yin Oolong takes its name from the Goddess of Mercy (Quan Yin), whose statues can often be found in front of Buddhist temples. Quan Yin is a bodhisattva, i.e. a person who has earned the right to leave this world of misery and enter nirvana, but who has volunteered to stay on earth and assist others in their quest for enlightenment. Legend has it that in a village whose temple was adorned by an iron (""ti"") statue of the goddess, one night Quan Yin appeared in a local farmer's dream and guided him to a cave behind the temple. There, she told him, he would find a treasure he was to tend and share with others. The treasure he did find when he went to the cave the very next morning turned out to be a small tea plant, which he took home and nursed. When it had grown to its full size, its leaves produced this particularly aromatic tea with the delicate fragrance of fruits and spices and a rich, golden color. As he had been bidden by the goddess, the farmer shared it with his neighbors, and he also dedicated it to Quan Yin in grateful appreciation of her gift.<br /><br />Goddess of Mercy Oolong makes for a great refreshment at any time of day and also goes well with meals. It can be enjoyed with or without milk (or cream), and its leaves will even yield a second cup when re-infused."	19	11
