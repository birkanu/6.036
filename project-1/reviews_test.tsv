1	B001BCVY4W	APP8XWYYV4PAA	Great cat food, even the dogs love it!	This is a great product for a finicky cat. It's really very rich as the ingredients are pure and there is no filler, which is great. Our cats love it more than Fancy Feast or any other higher end cat food!!! A can is eaten up in minutes!!!!<br /><br />Our dogs, of course, love cat food and want to partake in the feast!!!	0	2
1	B0058AMYTC	A1IRN1M05TPOVT	Kettle potato chips:  Fully loaded baked potato	I have never met a Kettle brand chip I did not like. These chips have a great loaded potato flavor, which are flavorful. I like the sweet onion chips better, but these are also at the top of the list for great-tasting potato chips. Kettle chips are great chips f/the money!	0	0

1	B002QWHJOU	A158Y8GYX115I3	My dog would do anything for Greenies	My dog absolutely loved Greenies. He would come downstairs every morning and sit in front of the pantry until someone gave him his Greenies. He also learned to do all sort of cute tricks. We taught him these tricks with Greenies as his incentive. These treats were healthy for him, never made him sick, and made his breath smell good. I would only give him one Greenies a day and to spread that one Greenie out over the entire day, I would take pliers and cut it into 6-8 little pieces. Seemed like my dog would feel more fulfilled to have little pieces throughout the day versus one whole Greenie once a day. Once I discovered Greenies, I cut all the other treats out and really only have him the Greenies. The 27oz. tub was in my opinion a really good value for the money so I would always buy that size. I highly recommend this product for all dogs.	0	0
1	B000FFLHU2	ATBF2HS5PZ98R	Very good taste and great nutrition!	I bought Navitas Maca after I tried a sample of another brand to add to my smoothies. I immediately felt the effect not in energy boost but in a very sharp and clear mind (surely the adaptogen qualities of the maca) a couple of minutes after I drank my raw cacao and maca smoothie and that effect lasted all morning long with just a tablespoon of maca.<br /><br />Indeed you have to let you body rest of maca about one week per month or the effects diminish or vanish. I noticed two weeks ago I wasn't having the same effect as before so this week I took Maca off my smoothies. But tomorrow: Maca again!!!<br /><br />I have never tasted along but in a Superfood smoothie and the smell is very good, almost sweet.	10	1
-1	B0029NGX34	A3J5FVO3TJL6VZ	Our cats threw up in pain after eating this food	We bought 2 packets (49 pouches in total) a few weeks ago for my 3 cats. One of the cats ignored this food completely to start with but the remaining two ate it. Anyways, a few days later we realized that both our cats who ate this food began throwing up in agony. Initially we didn't take it too seriously but they did this repeatedly two days in a row right after they ate this food. Hence, we have now switched back to the food we used to give them before and they are doing much better now.<br /><br />We also found that this food is NOT made in the USA but imported from Thailand, which they have not mentioned on this website.	2	1

1	B000Y6Z0DM	A39RU15LO1YS70	I love this stuff!	I think this product is fantastic! I blend it in with my smoothies. I tried it with just juice one day but didn't like the taste so i just use it in the blender with my other smoothie ingredients.It will turn everything green and it does have a unique taste but I love it and will keep buying it.	3	0
1	B001EQ4QJK	AEO407GROR6JB	Delicious and addictive!	These are the best snack food ever! Spicy AND healthy. The 100-calorie packs are a blessing 'cause I could gorge on them. The only drawback is they make your fingers messy, but that's a small price to pay.	1	0

1	B001LQCOIS	A3N1QGRX91V6YC	fast and easy	"I would not have had the confidence or time to make my own baby food without this machine. Super easy.<br />I read reviews about mold, so I've never kept the cap on the water basin when in storage and I've never had a problem. I absolutely LOVE this machine.<br />I had many baby recipe cookbooks. If you are looking for SIMPLE, which I was, I found <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0972722726"">So Easy Baby Food: A Personalized Guide to Making Baby Food At Home, 2nd Edition</a>  The beginning where it tells you how to make the baby food is useless (since we already had the Beaba baby food maker), but it quickly tells you what flavors go together nicely. My kids never rejected a combo suggested by this book.<br />Now that my kids are on solid foods, I primarily use the steamer. It's a quick and easy way to make steamed veggies without having to pull out all my gear.<br />My sister has borrowed this machine to puree veggies to hide in her 10 year olds food (<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/006176793X"">Deceptively Delicious: Simple Secrets to Get Your Kids Eating Good Food</a> ) So, I'm expecting to use it for years to come :-)"	3	0
1	B008LUTRG4	A1YZJ80VZ3IRV	"""My husband eats it like soup!"""	I can't buy the small jars of Oomas because my husband loves it so much he wants to eat the leftovers with a spoon right out of the pot. Perfect as is over pasta, but you can add your favorite extras or take a tried-and-true recipe to a new level of yum. Very smooth. Not too sweet. Just all around delicious. It is the only marinara sauce we eat. Better than anything I make myself.	1	0

1	B003Z6W32E	A35NJ3LSF0HFIF	Good deal on great coffee!	I really enjoy Starbuck's VIA Ready Brew, but on a tight budget, I can't always afford it. This deal ($29.99 for 50 packets with free shipping) made it affordable. I generally use a third to a half a packet with some milk and sweeten it with Truvia. In the summer I have it on ice, and in the winter I have it nice and hot.	0	0
1	B0080YLBTM	A34SF5J82FQEZF	Delightful!	I received my tillandsia plants today and they are exactly as promised. I ordered them on Friday afternoon and they were in my po box on Monday morning. I'm having a blast trying to decide which container or seashell or candlestick to display them on.	1	0
1	B004J2BEXW	A21WXTZ2XCOCRP	Fantastic and boneless	These are the best tasting sardine/herring I have found. So excited to have found them at BigLots for $2 a can!<br />Highly recommend these. All flavors are great. Much much better than any other brand I have yet tried. At this price, I will not be trying anything else to be honest.	0	0
1	B000F4F94S	A3JNKOF4GHXZKP	Tea Happy	I drink tea every day like some people drink coffee.  Lady Grey is my very favorite.  It is similar to Earl Grey, but with a milder and smoother taste.  :)  :)	0	0
1	B000MXJR8G	A39VNRG8P49QED	Great Snack	My daughter has been drinking these since about 10 months old, she's 14 months old and still loves them at snack time.  Healthy and delicious and they are a great addition to her menu.	0	0
1	B000EVOSE4	A325RWA8LHK2QJ	So addictive!	Oh my, how can anyone live without some gummi bears to chomp on?  I have been enjoying gummi bears for fifty years with the first being in Germany when I was a child. Through the years I have tucked some in a plastic bag while going to meetings, traveling, etc..  I have even been willing to share with people I like!  Haribo makes the best on the market today. Best flavor and texture by far.  I have a war with my self daily to not simply gobble up a handful of gummi bears as I pass through the kitchen.  Sometimes I resist and sometimes I don't.  I just keep my fingers crossed that Haribo will keep selling them just as they are now.	0	0
-1	B001WAL1NW	A3SDXGSB3E3AU9	So far, so good.	"My initial response to the lamp is very favorable - 1650 lumens @ 23 watts, reasonable price, promise of long life. It brightens up my area of use as hoped.<br />I chose the 3-star rating at this point because it is really too early to review a product  purported to last 7 years. If its performance remains close to the initial for a long time, it would rate 5 stars. Who knows?  My prior experience with ""7-year"" compact fluorescents isn't as compelling as the manufacturer's<br />advertising.  Amazon.com, of course, doesn't guarantee products for 7 years, but they referred me to the manufacturer, LITETRONICS, which says it does<br />stand by the Earthmate lamps.  I asked them about how a customer accesses the guarantee, if necessary, in the future.  They had to have a corporate<br />discussion, or something, before they responded,  but I received useful information. If any other purchaser is concerned about the guarantee, I suggest a<br />phone call or e-mail to Litetronics.  I learned from my discussion that one should be diffident about ""stockpiling"" a bunch of lamps for future use.  The<br />guarantee begins on the date of purchase.  [Save your Amazon sales receipt (for up to 7 years, if you wish).]"	6	7
1	B0057H5G6Y	A32STQC2FCJC6U	This isn't your ordinary rice!	"About as far as you can get from ""plain white"" rice, this blend of rice and barley AND rye offers a wonderful flavor, and texture, combination.<br /><br />I tried it on a whim and not only do I love it but everyone who as been visiting and tried it loves it too.<br /><br />HIGHLY recommended."	0	0
1	B005VOONM6	A2SSV6KM3W1VFD	Good coffee and fair trade	Good coffee and its a fair trade product so you can feel extra great inhaling the scent and complex yet simple flavors yet knowing you've helped the earth and the people on it a bit in your small way. Each drop of rain causes a ripple in a lake. One step at a time if we each do one thing like even falling for this easy to use organic coffee that will softly delight your tastebuds without overpowering them.	0	0
-1	B001LG945O	AKCZIJ6ZHE41D	Not So Bold Soda Alternative	I'm a fan of all-natural anything, especially when it's a tasty and healthy alternative to something I've enjoyed my whole life, but I know is 'bad' for me.<br /><br />Regular soda is one of those 'bad' things.  Loaded with artificial colors, sweeteners, corn syrup...yuck.  Hardly seems worth the risk when I'm also getting 150 empty calories on average.<br /><br />And now Switch has come along.  True to its claim, there's nothing artificial in it.  Just juice, sparkling water and other 'all natural' ingredients.<br /><br />That's great.<br /><br />So I chose this particular flavor (orange tangerine) because I wanted the strong citrus taste I love.  This drink, however, failed to meet their promise.  Yes, I can 'taste' the orangy citrus, but as much I can taste the apple and grape juices used as well.<br /><br />Moreover, this doesn't have that bold 'pop' to it as other carbonated beverages have.  I've had mineral water with more bite.<br /><br />But the worse part about this 'good for me' drink is in clocks in at 140 calories (the same as a regular can of Coke) and 36gcarb/34g sugar (compared with Coke at 39/39).<br /><br />On the up side, it has less than half the sodium as many regular colas and does deliver 100% Vit C and 20% Vit A. But if I wanted those kind of health benefits, I'd rather take them directly from the source: an orange.<br /><br />Overall, the all-natural health pros of Switch Orange Tangerine, simply don't justify the high calorie and carb count.  The Switch Beverage Co. may have done better to sell sparkling water with a twist of orange peel if they wanted to provide a truly healthy alternative to traditional sodas.	0	0
-1	B001ELL4RM	A37071Q86HR6FU	Not That Great	I like the beans in the can but coffee is average at best. Strong woody taste and no aroma. would not buy again.	1	0
1	B00472PZ8E	A33PVCHCQ2BTN0	Fantastic!	I love these crackers!  I'm new to gluten free, and have not tried many gluten free products. I don't know how these compare to other gluten free crackers.  But I do know that they are as good or better than any regular cracker I've tried.  Cracklebred crackers are light and airy, but very crispy.  They are a little delicate but still hold up under a gentle spread of hummus.  This variety is flavored with sun dried tomato and oregano, but I honestly did not pick up on those flavors.  I thought they tasted slightly savory, but I still enjoyed them with a spread of blueberry jam.  Each cracker contains just 17 calories so they are guilt free.  Yum :)	2	0
1	B005GYBI1A	A1X45MM8DJAOOE	Good variety!	This is a good variety of K-cups for those who like flavored coffee.  The flavor is subtle, and if you truly want a flavored coffee, you will need to add some sort of syrup, cinnamon, etc...as these really only give a hint of the flavor.  I haven't tried them all yet, but so far the Green Mountain Coffee Roaster's Hazelnut is my favorite.  I was dissappointed with a few of the varieties that tasted a little too bitter for me (like the Kahlua).	2	0
1	B001FA1JCW	A1JOCI3IKWBSS5	Baby Cereal He Loves	"My little boy always HATED baby cereal.  I tried everything - different brands, making it thick or thin, rolling it in balls and coating it with Cheerio dust.  Nothing worked until my pediatrician reccommended Farley's Rusks.  The rusks are baby food made into a biscuit form.  My boy has been eating ""cookies,"" as he calls them, for over a year and loves them.  With 1/5 of the daily iron he needs how can you go wrong?"	1	0
-1	B000WFRQQ4	A1Q9KZX1ZJ2OX	Watch expiration dates!1	1st: my cats really don't eat this brand with much relish like they did when Wellness had the mylar bags. We really miss those bags, the food just seemed to taste better to my cats. Canned, they won't touch any flavor but turkey.<br /><br />2nd: I've had 3 out of 12 in a case smell off and even the dogs won't touch it. So just check yours JIK.<br /><br />What has happened to this brand? They were the BEST 2 years ago!	0	2
1	B000NGP8UI	A2AMZRQLO1N55X	works for me!	having one with or after lunch totally eliminates the urge to find a quiet niche and cut a few zzzzz's.  i have a large capacity for caffeine so rockstar does not make me jumpy at all...just eliminates the drowsys.  the flavor may be an acquired taste but could be worse.  a small price to pay for the buzz.	2	1
-1	B006G7WC1G	A2QZ0Q7H8QLXBR	flavorless	I am not a coffee snob but craved coffee when I am pregnant, so I ordered some decaf.  I have to say i never touched again and its not worth the trouble ( not much of course) of making it	0	0

1	B000HZEK1I	A309XRV5MKT6ZS	Very Good Sugar Free Cookies	Murray's Sugar Free Peanut Butter cookies are one of my favorites and<br />are as good as any peanut butter cookies that are not sugar free. I keep<br />a supply on hand and my some of my friends have started buying them even<br />though they don't need to have sugar free products.  All Murray cookies<br />that I have bought have been very good. I'm a many times repeat customer.	0	0
1	B004FELBH8	A4KJTS5P78ICU	Great Cookies	These cookies are awesome. They taste very good and they are more heathly for you than most other cookies. They are very crisp and they are made with real fruit. They come in a variety of flavors. If you like Fig Newton's then you will like these cookies.	0	0
1	B001F6KGLG	A2ISGXJN8BKN6Y	Good stuff as coffee replacement	I have tried Teeccino Hazelnut and , while it does not taste much like coffee, it is a great morning hot beverage. I use 2 tablespoons and make on mug of the brew and use some maple syrup sweetner. Yum.<br />Many develop allergy to coffee and not just to caffeine but to some of the 300 other compounds in regular coffee. Beware of this.	1	0
1	B000EA3M4W	A1I33D43RQTL01	Raw Cane Sugar	I really like this sugar.  It's less processed than the sugars you generally find in stores.  It's definitely more expense so it's best to buy on a sale day.  It has worked great for me used in baking or just in morning coffee.	0	0
1	B002ANE43Y	A1KBYHP3MIRPV	Two Pit Bulls and two very sensitive stomachs.	"For all the hype that pitbulls get, you'd think they could eat license plates, dead trees and babies and not flinch.<br />The fact is that the dogs aren't nearly as tough as the media would mislead you to believe. And the reality is, most have extremely sensitive stomachs.<br />I know what you're thinking... ""awwweee... poor pit bulls!"" and that's my sentiment too!<br /><br />Especially when you live on the 16th floor and need to go up and down and up and down the elevator when they get the runs.<br />Not fun.<br /><br />These treats are perfect for training dogs, for small doges, for big dogs and for dogs who have sensitive stomachs. Like pit bulls.<br /><br />:)"	3	2
1	B003IHO8LY	A1TKI8EWZO6RRJ	Finally! :)	Like everyone on here I always have a hard time sleeping. Maybe 2-4 hours a night. I hate sleeping pills and have tried everything natural. The first time I tried this I was soothed into peaceful sleep. I had really awesome dreams too. Slept 8 hours. The 2 most important things about this drink<br />1. I actually slept through the entire night (which never happens)<br />2. I didn't feel groggy at all in the morning.<br /><br />I use it once or twice a week now. The store near my house just had them on sale for $1.99 a bottle! Good deal for a good night's sleep.<br /><br />You should seriously consider trying this if you have trouble with sleeping.	0	0

1	B004U8Z4LS	A3QV7Y0Q7OYY8E	Product is great but new packaging by A&H is not	This cat litter is the best I have found.  I am a foreign service officer and use to purchase it while at my previous post.  I had extra boxes shipped to my next post and while that shipment arrived (6 months till I got settle at the next post) I purchased more cat litter for my cats.<br /><br />Now that I have settled at my new post and can look at the previous boxes and the new, I noticed two differences:  1) The new packaging no longer places the litter in a plastic bag inside the litter box; and 2) the box top now has a handle.  While the handle may make it easier to transport the box, not having a plastic bag holding the litter inside the box lets the litter spill out from the seams very easily.<br /><br />I love the product, but I will no longer purchase it while in this packaging because all five boxes I have purchased to arrive at my new post have arrived with the litter spilling out of the seams, making a mess of the mailroom as well as losing some of the product.  To clarify, this has nothing to do with the packaging Amazon does, it is from the manufacturer.	7	0
1	B001LG940E	A1QO88MU0PYJON	Loved it...	Our family is a huge fan of IZZE and this was right in line with that.  The flavor was not too sweet and refreshing.

1	B0073IFWWS	A12N8VRQ61HVD9	The BEST Beef Jerky I've ever tasted!	When I was in college in Virginia, I used to buy King B beef jerky, ripple cut. I loved this jerky because it wasn't too sweet, it was very thin and it had a great overall taste and texture. Fast forward to today... King B apparently has been out of business for sometime or absorbed by anther company from what I read, plus they don't sell this stuff in Brooklyn, so as far as finding some of this stuff, almost impossible. Enter Golden Valley Natural: This stuff tastes better than I remember. The texture is just as I remember, the flavor is BETTER and it's just as thin. No sweet tasting jerky here, just great flavor that isn't too overwhelming and just perfect for a snack. This is coming from a person who is: 1) Super particular 2) Not easily impressed 3) Looking for this stuff for close to 10 years (so it better be as good if not better). I lucked out and I have a feeling you'll feel the same way! Good job GVN!	0	0

-1	B001SB62OS	A2BUSR3U0RVFAM	Beef Soup Seasoning Base	This product is good, but not great. I don't really expect to repurchase.  The flavor is o.k but it seemed like I had to use alot of it to get the flavor I was looking for.  In a pinch I would use it again, but only because it is gluten free. I think some other gluten free brands work better for me.	6	1

-1	B002Z2QBOA	A1LNZH1JU048LL	Really?	So I am partly at fault for my poor raring. I had entered in the search for egg nog coffee and this popped up. I figured 48 Egg nog k-cups for 49.999 (which is what I paid here...of course today it is on sale) was kind of high however I was thinking it was just the egg nog, which is my favorite. It arrived (damamged I might add) and it is a combination of 3 flavors...2 of which no one in my house likes. What really is awful is I paid 50 bucks...this exact same box is at my local walmart for 25.99. The price is WAY too high...totally not worth it.	2	2
1	B001L1IQHQ	A1K1M1DD5SFC2O	great coffee, horrible customer service (buy at amazon)	This is by far the best flavored coffee compared to Starbucks, Dunkin Donuts, Green Mountain, Peets, and any other I can think of.  Genuine sweet chocolate and rasberry smell and flavor.  A yummy sweet version that tastes exactly right (not like any other flavor).  I strongly recommend this one, cinnamin, pumpkin, and german chocolate cake.  Just don't join Gevalia.  There customer service is terrible.  If you google them you'll see.  Order from Amazon instead.	0	0
1	B0000D8DI0	A8DMQT6S54CZR	Very smooth with a little more sweetness than the 88%	This used to be my favorite dark chocolate until I discovered the 88% dark Hachez bars.  One reviewer thought it was crumbly but my guess is that they had something cold in their mouth before eating it - you don't want to do that with dark chocolate or it doesn't melt on the tongue very well. This company makes some very smooth but intense chocolate for those who don't like the bitterness or sourness of very dark chocolate.  I just came home from Germany and stocked up on Hachez at the duty free shop.  I wish I'd bought more.  This stuff is fantastic!	0	0

1	B007I7YZJK	A35JP8KSV9281K	Yummy mango tea	Delicious and refreshing with a fresh mango taste. I can't taste the pineapple at all which is too bad because I got this specifically for that.

1	B001RVFERK	A13FEDZA2FZLCC	My favorite brand of chips	"When I first heard about Popchips I thought they'd end up tasting like either kettle cooked chips or Cape Cod style chips. I was wrong. They are light, airy, and have a great taste to them... (a note to the makers of Popchips, however, there does need to be better quality control - I will randomly get a bag of chips that are, for lack of a better description I'll say ""harder"" than the majority of the batches I buy.)<br /><br />The Salt & Pepper variety is the flavor I love the most. It has a nice kick to it (if you're not into heat, you might want to stay away from this flavor and stick with my other favorite 'original'... otherwise, just have a bottle of water nearby.) I would definitely recommend this for anyone who is a lover of chips."	0	0
1	B0026HG4SM	AJ096IUZ49MZF	Great decorations	I purchased these for cupcakes I was making for a baby shower.

I thought is was such  great idea to have multigrain cereal just like what I eat.<br />BIG MISTAKE.<br />This gave my baby the most horrible gas and it took me months to realize it was the cereal causing this. Only when my mother-in-law said ""Boy, if I eat whole grain cereal in the evening, i act like a trumpet all night"" did I think.

1	B000LKUTIM	A279EDYSM2WQCF	Awesome!	I love this pasta.  I try to stay away from wheat containing products as much as possible and tried out Ancient Harvest brand pasta based on a friend's recommendation.  It's wonderful.  I've even got my boyfriend hooked on it, both of us maintaining that it even tastes better than normal pasta and whole wheat pasta.  I think the trick to making sure the texture of this pasta is al dente is to cook it for a shorter period of time than recommended on the box.  I think they suggest 10minutes, I always cook mine for 8 minutes.	2	0
1	B0007A0AQW	A992JQJZGMUQT	Perfet bite sized treats!	These treats are wonderful. They are healthy and you can tell they are full of EFA's. They do smell to high heaven of fish, so if you can't stand that smell, you won't like these. My dog won't eat fish, but she LOVES these. My dog does not drool, except when you open these up! These are her favorite treats, and she is a 45lb medium mutt. They are perfect for training rewards. She hates having her nails clipped, so when we clip her nails, I have my fiance pinch one of these in his fingers and she tries to get it from him and she's totally distracted from me clipping her nails. The price is right especially if you have prime!	0	0

1	B000LO40AG	A2SI78R33PC5JR	Rooster Sauce...	As you can probably tell from the other reviews, this stuff is the new ketchup. It's popping up in restaurants and other venues, and for good reason: its tastes amazing! I can take really hot stuff, but this sauce isn't about killing your taste buds (or killing you). Instead, it lets you actually experience the flavor of the chilis front and center, while also complementing it with a strong garlic taste. I love to put this on hot dogs and hamburgers, as well as ramen noodles. Of course, feel free to experiment, I still experiment putting this on anything and everything if I think it might taste good.<br /><br />Believe it or not this sauce is made in America, despite its non-American-looking bottle. Its also as a pretty simple ingredient list that doesn't make you cringe when you look at it. I would recommend buying this (the 28oz bottle) as it is a much better deal than buying the smaller (17oz) one.	0	0
1	B000F4DK9Y	A31DCDCIEX0S35	Tea, please.	We have been drinking Twinings Prince of Wales tea for about 5 years now. It's a full-bodied black tea that, even when steeped a little too long, is never bitter. Loose tea is soooo much better than bagged tea (just dust and bits!). I was having trouble finding it here, but Amazon came through once again! I highly recommend this blend.	2	1
-1	B001ELL60W	A1T43UUK4EDHC2	a bit too sweet!	You have probably had these waffles before if you've ever gone to a gourmet ice cream shop and they make those waffle cones for you while you wait.  The waffles are decent, and I suppose most people would like them,  I found them a bit too sweet and too much butter . . so you may have to adjust the recipe somewhat.  I thought the pancakes were horrible using this product  .  . . Aunt Jemimah won't be losing any sleep over this pancake mix, that's for sure.<br /><br />Bottom line:  Pretty good waffles if you like them sweet like a waffle cone . .  Pancakes are not as good as store bought brands.  I wanted to return the unused cans, but Amazon won't let me return grocery products.	8	2
1	B000WFORH0	AIKGBCYBXVH8I	Cat Food	My cats eat it that is all I can say.  I try and buy the best food available but we cat owners can only say our cats eat it or will not eat it.

-1	B001EQ4NWK	A32AKKZRP848H8	Worth Noting	Look at the larger view of the packaging and you'll see that these are sourced from the USA and China.

I would give serious thought to food products that source any of their ingredients from China.	9	7

Clearly it was not 6 lb given that the bottle is under 1 lb.  Basically, you end up paying well over 2 times what you should - $12.99 for 12 ounces.	0	2

1	B007RTR89S	AB0TLNLNOAGY4	Hair Pleasing--Worth the Splurge	My unmanageable mane of hair currently falls to the middle of my back.  It's very fine, tangles easily and tends to confound many shampoos.  Given the amount of hair, I am used to having to use a lot of product just to work up a lather.  I've occasionally used some higher end brands and given up simply because I'm pouring out too much  at once trying to work up a lather.  It's hardly worth the price if I'm use a quarter of the bottle at a time.  Cheaper shampoos tend to fall into two categories, gloppy or watery enough to run out of my hand.  I've tended to use them because of price, but it's a quick suds and wash with the objective to get my hair rinsed as quickly as possible.<br /><br />This shampoo is neither gloppy nor too watery.  I can pop up the spout and use just about a quarter sized amount of shampoo to lather up the entire mass of hair.  It lathers quickly, with a pleasant texture and smell and rinses out without the feeling I've either dried my hair out  or left a stick residue.  My hair is noticeably more manageable, especially when I have to brush it out and detangle it (which is a chore).  I'm able to get it combed and ready for my day in about half the time it takes with cheaper shampoos. While I don't like this shampoo quite as much as the Shea shampoo, it's a wonderful go-to for my color weary hair that doesn't cost my grocery budget to buy.  As with all products, if you have sensitive skin, it's probably worthwhile to be cautious with anything not designed for sensitive skin.  I haven't had any problems with it, and my skin appears to be less dried out than usual after showers--which is a plus.<br /><br />^_^ Shanshad	0	0

-1	B000LKVL16	ABAQ9SKKJ8Y67	Primary Flavor is Sugar	"I don't want to say these are awful but I won't ever get them again. The praise in other reviews, especially for the hickory strips, convinced me to try them. I now suspect the praise was ""planted"" by vested interests.<br /><br />The weaknesses of the product are legion. First, it's so hard to get the package open I had to get out the scissors; thinking you could get it open while hiking is delusional. You'll have to stop along the trail and get out a tool. I recommend a hatchet.<br /><br />Finally opened, the first realization is that slugs are less slimy. This in no way resembles a jerky if that's what you were hoping for. It's more like a piece of fruit leather that got left in the bathtub over night. Or just a mashed slug.<br /><br />Then there's the taste.  It basically tastes like sugar. Very unhealthy treat for diabetics certainly; you'll need an electron microscope to read the molecular fine print, but basically it provides a heavy load of cane sugar.<br /><br />At best this is like slimy candy, not jerky at all, not even close. For a vegetarian jerky product that is both tasty and relatively healthy and won't leave your fingers covered in pancake syrup, I recommend Stonewall's Jerqee."	1	1
1	B000I5HBS6	A1AMKWEY3RT1O7	Convenient to use and store	The description may be a little unclear, so just to clarify, you are getting 12 boxes, each box has 3 packets, so a total of 36 packets.  Each packet makes 1Qt of milk.  Those of you that have purchased powdered milk before will see how convenient this this.  To get powdered for a reasonable price at the store, you need to buy the biggest box they have.  The problem there is that as soon as you open it, you need to find better containers to store it in, preferably air tight and not made of plastic.<br /><br />The smaller packets you get with this product remove the need to find secondary storage containers.  Because you don't have to open it all at once, you don't have to worry about the moisture making the milk go bad, or light reducing the vitamin quality.<br /><br />If you have never used powdered milk before, there are some nice benefits.  The main benefit to me is that it doesn't go bad.  I don't drink enough milk to justify buying it by the gallon, and even buying half gallon sizes it would go bad before I could use it.  With powdered milk I never have to worry about it going bad, nor do I need to wonder if I have milk on hand.<br /><br />Now, as for taste, I don't drink milk by itself, powdered or not.  I've read that if you do, it's best to mix it up and then let it sit in the fridge for a few hours.  I use it in protein shakes, where it tastes no different than regular milk.  I imagine it would be great for things like smoothies as well.<br /><br />Another great use for powdered milk is adding it to coffee.  Much healthier for you than powdered non-dairy creamer, and just as creamy and delicious.  And, unlike regular milk, the powdered milk will not cool down your coffee nearly as much.  I've gotten a few people hooked on using powdered milk in their coffee.	20	0

-1	B0006LKDS2	A3OJUTMM1DS2W	Not happy!	"I had such great hopes for this Bundt cake mix - I am grateful that I was testing it prior to serving it for a special occasion.  The ""caramel sauce packet"" consists of caramel pellets that I imagine are supposed to melt during the baking process - but only a portion melted - and the top of my Bundt cake looks like the surface of the moon!!!  My finished cake has huge holes in the top from where the little pellets didn't melt - and, upon removing the cake from the pan, the unmelted pellets (or chips or whatever) stuck to the pan like glue.  I followed this recipe to the letter and I am a great baker so I am sure that the product was old (although the freshness date states that it is fresh until May 2011) or it was ruined somehow on the shelf or in transit.<br /><br />Considering that my investment in this cake is 3 eggs, a cup of whole milk and one and a half sticks of butter - plus my initial purchase cost - plus my time and energy - I am truly not happy.  And of course have no way to return this item.  Arghh."	0	0

1	B003O7VULY	A3LJQQ1MUMKRRN	!!!!!!! YEAH !!!!!!	This is THE best hot seasoning out there.  It's super hot and at first all you may get out of it is hot, but if you're in it for pure heat then go with the 3am special reserve from blair (basically pure, slightly diluted capsaicin). However, this powder has a great flavor of its own as well as acting like MSG by exciting all the other flavors in your food - so power through the first few applications, let your system get used to it, then everything tastes way better because of it.  I use it on everything except sweets.  People will be insulted when you want to sprinkle on their homemade dish because they don't understand that it's not like normal hotsauce; just tell them that it's exactly like their salt and pepper but more-so.<br /><br />The best part is no matter how much hot you are used to, you can achieve a superior sharp burn without the acid reflux side-effects of super-hotsauce (pure capsaicin actually counteracts acid reflux and ulcer problems fyi) or the intestinal problems associated with non-extracted habanero or ghost chili powder.  Or you can just get some heat and flavor - whatever you're in the mood for, Nitro will abide.  Additionally, it's much harder to get hot-eyes with Nitro than with super-hotsauces because it's a powder and doesn't stay on your hands.<br /><br />non-chiliheads: I suggest you go with Blair's Death Rain Habanero - great flavor without as much heat (still hot though, it's about 1/4th as hot as Nitro by weight).<br /><br />caution: do not fry	0	0
1	B000F0JOR0	AGWL0RQ7QBZQ8	This cereal is wonderful	This cereal has everything. Great flavor, tons of fruit and nuts, it's absolutely great tasting. My kids ate all six boxes within days. The only complaint is the boxes are small. They're about half the size of a box of Chex, if you have one standing next to it in the pantry (which I currently do). But for all natural cereal without any of the garbage in it that my kids actually eat and want more of, you can't beat this stuff!	4	0

A little goes a long, long way. I had no problems with bloating, they taste like nothing, and they pack a nutritional wallop.

1	B001VIIXXQ	A1D09LESOYH2ZQ	Great Afternoon Tea	"I've always gone back and forth between a good strong black tea and a very subtle green tea.  Tetley's falls firmly in the black tea area.  As a previous reviewer mentioned, these are little tea nuggets, the description from Amazon initially made me think these were going to be the tiny leaves I expected from a ""loose leaf"" tea, be forewarned, these won't unfurl into tea leaves in the pot or the bottom of your cup, they'll remain little nuggets, which doesn't detract from the tea, I assure you.<br /><br />This is a great, basic black tea.  At this price it is great, and for the amount you get, you can easily make this an everyday tea, not something you save for ""occasions"" whether special or routine.  I like it because it is just that, simple and straightforward.  I don't need to think about whether a book is good enough to warrant me brewing up a cup to enjoy with it, I'll make this tea anytime I want a decent cup of tea.<br /><br />I'm not an expert of tea by far, but I do think this one brews a bit strong for the amount.  The 3-5 minute steeping time is great for me, but I enjoy strong, dark coffee and tea, and if you're expecting the color of the cup on the box, aim a little lower in your measuring.<br /><br />On a side note, consider buying a smaller container to get your daily portion and keeping the Tetley box sealed up, it is really a huge amount of tea, a bit unwieldy to get a couple spoons from it daily and the less tea is exposed to air, the better."	5	0

1	B00122E5SS	A1CI3K4CPDPCCK	my favorite smoked salmon brand	I've tried three brands of smoked salmon.<br />Chicken of the Sea smoked salmon in the 3oz package is by far my favorite.<br />I pour the liquid from the pouch onto dried cat food, the the cats love it.<br />Rinsing the smoked salmon in the pouch removes the salt taste in my experience.<br /><br />Good at room temperature, nibbled from the pouch and on sandwiches, but I also use it for omelette's and salads.<br />Am here because I got tired of asking store managers to please stock more & decided to buy online in bulk.<br /><br />It keeps fresh in the pouch a long time btw.

1	B001E5E33U	A122GFTJ7K07D8	Good rendition of tea for an instant machine	Let's not fool ourselves, tea from a Keurig is not the same as brewing tea in a teapot and letting it steep.  If you typically make tea by dunking a tea-bag in a cup of hot water then you will like this tea.  Overall it tastes pretty good, better than I expected.  In fact you can make two cups of tea or one very large mug from one pod.  One cup is a little strong tasting (and I actually like strong tea).  I will buy this product again as it was a good value and for those times I don't feel like waiting to boil water and let the tea steep these Twinning K-cups are an acceptable alternative.	3	0

1	B000NMJWZO	A1RQMG95ZPST7A	Best gluten-free baking mix ever	"Don't even bother with other gluten-free baking mixes - this one's the best!  Why I love it:<br /><br />1) Excellent taste.  I've experimented with other gluten-free mixes and there's usually something ""off"".  I even tried one that had a strange, subtle metallic flavor.  I've fooled gluten eaters with Pamela's - they couldn't differentiate from gluten pastries.<br /><br />2) Anyone who's ever had to bake for a gluten-free diet knows the annoyance of procuring and figuring out xanthan gum.  In Pamela's case, the xanthan gum's already included in the mix, so there's one less thing to worry about.  I tried baking cookies without Pamela's mix and forgot the xanthan gum.  Surprise, surprise, my cookies didn't rise.  So this is important.<br /><br />3) Versatility.  So far, I've made pancakes, scones, crepes, chocolate chip cookies, pizza crust and cakes with Pamela's.  The range of what you can make with this mix is amazing.  Any time I have to create a gluten-free version of an old favorite food, I can probably create something using Pamela's.<br /><br />4) For what it's worth, the recipe ideas on the back of the bag are very helpful - AND ACCURATE.  I've gotten so annoyed by inaccurate recipes on food packages.  By contrast, I've found the ingredient amounts on the bag of the mix bag to be good.<br /><br />As with most gluten-free prepared mixes, Pamela's is a little pricey.  Even with this discounted deal of 3 bags, you're still paying nearly $15 a bag.  But the bags themselves are pretty big - it takes me weeks to go through 1 bag, but I'm an amateur baker.  If you're a professional or you bake more often than the average person, your needs will of course be different.  Also, the sheer quality makes the price worth it.  I can't imagine baking with anything else now."	1	0

1	B0026VM19Y	A3OXHLG6DIBRW8	Good Tasting Sugar Free Dip/Topping - Recommended	"The Walden Farms Marshmallow Dip was a good find for me, but perhaps calling this ""Marshmallow"" was a mistake since it only slightly resembles marshmallow by looks and taste. It should be treated as a dessert dip/topping for dieters or diabetics. Being a Type 2 diabetic, I am always looking for low carb sweets that will not impact my blood sugar levels and this Dip/Topping has no impact at all.<br /><br />I like the flavor and use it on other sugar free foods to round out the dish. This works well with sugar free chocolate ice cream and with peanut butter sandwiches.<br /><br />Recommended, if you set your expectations to match the reality that this is not really marshmallow.

The noodles do smell once you take them out of the package; however, they cook up rather easily.  They will stick together - so when you take them out of the water and put them on paper towels, make sure that you lay them out - otherwise, you will have issues later.  They do NOT have a taste, so make sure that you stir fry them or let them simmer with whatever you are using them with, otherwise, you will be disappointed.

1	B000SWTKV0	A29P53TYBV1P9K	Best flavor of any sea salt I have tried!	Great product.  Yummy!  Tastiest sea salt out there as far as I am concerned.  Nice price for this much salt.  Grains are large (and very salty) so it's easy to over salt stuff, you'll get used to using it quickly.  I have bought other sea salts that were much more expensive, but I genuinely prefer this.  It's grey in color (that may bother some but not me) and too moist to put in salt grinders (I'm considering trying the fine grain version).  Great to use when marinating your finest bad-ass Fred Flintstone-type steaks!  Try this, I highly recommend!	2	0

They do not have the white plastic ""cup,"" instead the part under the foil top is coffee-filter material in a curved-bottom shape. So only the foil top is pierced when the machine brews.

1	B000DZH19K	AVSMQJ3CS3BV8	Not missing out on anything!	My daughter is newly on a GFCF diet and her birthday is coming up. I made cupcakes for her preschool using a Cherrybrook Kitchen boxed mix and it was so disappointing (stiff, odd-tasting). For her birthday cake proper, I tried Pamela's Luscious Chocolate Cake Mix instead and WOW it's just really delicious cake! It doesn't seem like a dietary restriction at all. One advantage of Pamela's is that you add your own eggs, so I separated the eggs, beat the whites and folded them in gently at the end (being sure not to overmix, as the package instructs). The cake was fluffy, moist and completely delicious, with a fairly fine crumb. Be sure you bake it until it springs back to the touch, otherwise it may fall and just be a moist wad -- at least that's my experience with other GF baked goods.	0	0

I am the owner of a new cat that I started out on a supermarket indoor cat formula, since he had been fed dry food while at the shelter.  While the cat ate this other food heartily, he soon began vomiting on a daily basis.  I did some research on the internet and found that this food, Natural Balance, is considered to be among the best cat foods out there of the dry variety.  Since my cat would not really touch wet food at the time, I decided to give it a try.  Not only did my cat love it, but all of his problems with vomiting disappeared overnight.  I am currently feeding him a combination of Natural Balance Original dry and a variety of wet foods.  He is doing great so far...lots of energy...and he really looks forward to mealtime.

-1	B002GWFB68	AL00KTRHKZ39S	Can't fully endorse, beware of problems	As an amateur home roaster I cannot fully recommend this product.  First the good, you get some nice varieties, nothing too exotic but fine nonetheless, some are even blended for espresso.  The sample packs are a bit under a lb, a decent amount for a home roaster and ideal for my behmor.  You even get some bonus mugs.  So far I've done some good roasts, but watch out for the blends.  I've had to actually throw away two of the blends without even trying to roast them.  The beans were just gnarly, especially one of the house blends, no excuse for that kind of quality control.  I hope other purchasers didn't get any packages like that.  I'm not saying never buy this product, but definitely beware, you can do a lot better.  If you're an amateur home roaster absolutely find a local commercial roaster, perhaps one with a small coffee shop.

1	B002P936UK	A19MMYMZO363KM	Good tea wish it came in loose tea too.	I am sensitive to Caffeine and supposedly the White teas have 1/3 approx. what Black teas contain. And about half of what the green teas contain. This probably varies all over the place however. Often a decaf tea isn't. If you want no caf you need to look for caf free teas and drinks. I find a kick to this white tea but it definitely is not as bad as some of black teas. My husband and I can't tolerate a lot of tannins and this seems to be high in them as the other reviewer mentioned it's astringent properties. But we temper that with milk or 100% Cranberry Juice concentrates as well as lemon juice or powdered. Good both hot or iced. Looking forward to making sun tea for ice tea with these bags. Look on the net this item is cheaper as are all the Prince of Peace items else where even after paying shipping which is usually reasonable. I hope they don't up the price just because everyone else's white tea is higher. I wish it was available in a loose tea too. A smooth flavored good tasting tea that reminds me of teas I had as a child and at Chinese restaurants. Beats anything I can buy in local supermarkets.<br /><br />I did try the organic version and no way. This one is better for some reason. Stronger and overall a better product even the bag it'self is better than the organic's.	1	1

1	B000OQ2DL4	A32C3JZ8S2DKT0	Thirsty after taking Natural Calm?	Hi, does this supplement make you super thirsty?  I wanted to check because I have been feeling very thirsty especially in the late evening.  It has coincided with me taking this supplement.  But I have heard that excessive thirst is also symptom of diabetes.  Is it documented anywhere that magnesium can result in thirst?  If anyone can share this info, it would be greatly appreciated.<br /><br />As for the product, I just started it.  The taste is citrusy.  I have had no side effects other than thirst.  But I don't know how much is psychological I have already been feeling more energy.  I will update if I continue this for a longer time hopefully.	0	0
-1	B000BY50BY	A1PR2ON667KV09	Disappointed second-time buyer	This is the second time I bought these beef tendons. The first time they were fine - the shape was long, the way they are supposed to be, and they were easy for my dog to chew.  But this last time, the shapes were bulky and awkward and resulted in my dog's choking on one of these irregular and strange-shaped pieces that she tried to swallow and that got stuck in her throat. The choking episode went on for 15 minutes and ended only when she vomited her entire stomach contents. it was very frightening.	6	1
1	B001FA1KSA	AQQLWCMRNDFGI	Part of an effort to make diet healthier	It's so easy to grab some unhealthy snack foods when one has an urge to eat between meals. Over time, I have tried to discipline myself to better quality snacks. One part of that has been nuts and peanuts. Plasnter's produces a nice decent sized package of peanuts--16 full ounces.<br /><br />The peanuts are nice and crunchy (maybe a bit too much salt). Still, better than candy bars or fried snacks or. . . .	1	0

1	B002LANN56	ACJT8MUC0LRF0	We've been using Chef Michael's for a long time and our satisfaction level is high ...	"Chef Michael's Grilled Sirloin Steak Flavored dog food has been my choice of dog food for quite some time.  I used to feed both of my dogs the same food, but when my smaller one developed seizure activity I decided to change.  One of the things I liked about this particular brand is that it doesn't have any ""suspect"" ingredients such as rosemary extract which have been rumored to exacerbate such activity in small dogs.  No, he has not been cured, but with anti-seizure medication and a food sans ""natural"" ingredients I feel more comfortable with his diet.<br /><br />When I went to the store to select his new food I stood in the dog food aisle for a long time and read every single dry dog food label in the store.  Chef Michael's was the one of choice.  One other thing I liked that the FIRST ingredient was beef.  Dogs are carnivores and need the protein.  I could do without the added color, but that obviously makes people feel better.  The food is loaded with tender pieces of beef and my dog loves the taste.<br /><br />My dog is small and this food lasts for quite a while.  If you want to keep it fresh, you might also want to add a <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000A6UF4U"">Gamma Vittles Vault Plus</a> container to your order.  I do have to cut up some of the ""tender pieces"" as they are large. These pieces also make great treats for my larger dog, who can often be found begging for one when I'm preparing their meals.

1	B000GAT6NG	A195LVXMBCFKJX	Great Oil - Great Price	There's been a lot said recently about the benefits of Coconut oil.  But it's difficult to find quality oil for a good price.  Nutiva extra virgin coconut oil from Amazon.com makes it affordable.  Coconut oil is the best oil to saute with as it doesn't turn into a carcinogen at the regular temp we cook at.  We also add it to our green smoothies, and often use it with a drop of essential oil as an overall skin conditioner in conjunction with our chosen safe skin care line that is much more natural and effective than other things available on the market.  I'm always looking for better ways to help our family be as healthy as possible.  This is a great product to help with that goal.	2	0

-1	B00028HN5A	A2394E707C1L6C	WAS great, but no longer	This is a new review - the stuff i ordered last Christmas was WONDERFUL, so I ordered two cans to make catnip toys for the 12 or so cats I know. I opened this up, and my cat who loved the last tin had no reaction. The new stuff has a difference color and appearance. Putting them right next to each other, they only show interest in the old stuff. The catnip toys also have no affect on them, which means I wasted my time making them and there will be a lot of bored cats this year when they open their presents. Rubbing it between my fingers didn't make it fragrant enough for them to care either.<br /><br />I am leaving some out on a little tray for them and I've seen them walk up and munch it a couple of times now over a week, but it's more like when you go browse in the fridge cause you're bored so you put something in your mouth, not eating something because you're hungry and it's really appealing, if you know what I mean. So what I have will last a very very long time, I will probably order it one more time when I run out to see if next year's crop is closer to the original tins I purchased.<br /><br />(note: my MIL claims her cats are into the toys I made them, so I don't know if they aren't as picky as my cats or she said that to spare my feelings)<br /><br />Old Review: When they stopped selling cosmic catnip at Petco I went in search of a new catnip. I have three cats, and one of them is a fiend, the other two don't care so much. We tried one that I ended up finding bugs in several months later :(. I got some of this for my MIL's cats last Christmas, and a tin for us, and the fiend loves it, and one of the cats that only ate catnip if I spent a lot of time smooshing it between my fingers for him to increase the smell actively eats this catnip without me trying to coerce him, so I am really happy and impressed with this brand.	2	0
1	B001QEAVSU	A3SDPMQZR3JA29	I have a brat...	I bought this as an addition to the natural, healthy, holistic path I have put my dog on. I personally can't speak towards the actual contents of the bottle and its efficiency but her coat looks shinier, she seems healthier and she won't eat her meals unless there are a few pumps of oil on it.<br /><br />Side Note: I haven't bought this from Amazon before but the price on here beats anywhere locally that I have purchased it. Definitely a great deal.	0	0

-1	B000P49A1Q	A2TYHWXZPE415M	I was Disappointed	The description of these bars led me to believe they were made of premium chocolate with a Swiss-like texture and flavor. Not so at all. Don't get me wrong; they were not disgusting or gross. They tasted mostly like chocolate. But they in no way tasted premium. The texture was too firm and they didn't melt properly in the mouth. Erythritol is the best sweetener for chocolates in my opinion because it doesn't produce the gastrointestinal distress that most sugar alcohols produce. But it is not as sweet as sugar and any good chocolate recipe should compensate for this by adding sucralose for its synergy.<br /><br />I used to buy the Ross chocolate bars, which are sweetened with maltitol. I couldn't eat but one per day due to the side effects of the sweetener, but sometimes I ventured two because they are smooth, creamy, and sweet, the way great chocolate always is. By comparison, the Chocoperfection bars are like cheap knock-offs. Except that they're not cheap. If they cost a lot less I might buy them again because they do offer something like a chocolate bar taste with no evil side effects. But I won't be buying any more at the current price.	7	0

1	B000WFNW4O	ARROCMTU1772T	My Chihuahua Loves this Stuff	I've been feeding Wellness food to my Chihuahua for nearly a year and she loves it. She dances around eager for her breakfast when I start scooping it into her dish. I would give it 5 stars, except that it is difficult to find in the 6 oz size, and it has that room-filling reek that most canned dog foods have (which my dog loves, but I hate). She has not had any digestive issues with the food, and I like that the first three ingredients on the list are all turkey, and the following three are vegetables. I can actually see the sweet potato in the food. My dog doesn't have any food allergies, but I have read that foods using alternative meats such as turkey, lamb and duck can help if your dog has poor reaction to beef based foods. As long as they keep making this, I'll keep buying it.	1	0
1	B007I7YZJK	A3MUSWDCTZINQZ	Slight aftertaste, but is good for what it is	This tea tastes a bit like strawberry jam to me.  It's sweet, but not too sweet.  I tried dissolving it in both a glass of cold water and shaking it in a plastic water bottle. Both ways produces a good blend of the product with little or no powder left.  I already finished my box, so that is a testament to how refreshing it is. It's a good substitution for soda or if you want something treat-like in your water.	0	0

1	B0018Q2N3C	A3DAEVMDSPGKWB	Great Tasting Low Carb Pasta	I have used Dreamfields Healthy Carb Living pastas for over a year now.  I like the taste of whole wheat pastas, but some people don't or they don't want to eat it all the time.  If you are a low-carber (or not) who misses the regular semolina pasta with all the full-carb taste, then this pasta is definitely for you.  It tastes Sooooo good!  I have tried all of the shapes, and they are all great.  No more waiting for special occasions or treats to get the high-carb taste you love.  With 1 gram fat, 5 grams fiber (4g soluble/1g insoluble), 7 grams protein, and only 5 grams digestible carbs, you can't go wrong buying this great product.<br /><br />Dreamfields is great for those who have diabetes or metabolic or insulin resistance, or people who want to eat low-glycemic, low-carb, Atkins, Body for Life, etc.  Macaroni and Cheese, Lasagna, Meatballs and Spaghetti, Linguine with Clam Sauce, Penne Primavera--endless possibilities for low-carb meals, now.  I can't wait for other shapes to be introduced (hint, hint)--fettucine, cavatappi, orzo, angel hair, and on and on.	19	0

It's definitely a good quality flavored coffee with a medium body. Overall, I have enjoyed several cups of this and have temporarily shelved my Timothy flavored k-cups in favor of this one. I sometimes add sugar free vanilla syrup, cream, and cinnamon. It's excellent that was in place of dessert. I also tried caramel syrup added to this... don't do it. It overwhelms the flavor.	5	0

1	B0002DGRRA	A12MGOJOF9FY8P	Corgi Cocaine	We cut these up into small pieces for our Corgi pup (so each treat actually becomes 8-10 mini treats) to prevent throwing off his diet.  This allows us to give him multiple treats for going potty outside (like 3-5 mini treats each time).  We also use these whenever our puppy meets a stranger -- we make sure all four paws are on the ground before we give it to him and he has already learned to inhibit his desire to jump up on people!  These are amazing and I appreciate that they are made in the USA -- no weird chemicals to worry about -- and our pup loves to work for them!	0	0

1	B0052UESYC	AGQ1H5KVAR3L8	Awesome Product!	"My dog loves these!  We have been giving them to him since the day we brought him home 2 1/2 years ago and he still loves them.  He is picky about what food he will eat and we have had to change brands several times because he just won't eat anymore once he has made up his mind. But, he has never gotten tired of these.  He knows when he is getting a ""cookie"" he has done something really good, and he is always excited.  They are a great product.  I used to be able to buy them from the ""chain"" pet store in the area, and I was really bummed when they stopped selling them.  I have been ordering them direct from the manufacturer for well over a year, but I love that Amazon has them now.  I also buy the Mini Paws Peanut Butter Dog Cookies from this company.  We have been using them since day one too, we used them as the training tool since they are tiny.  I can't say enough good things about this product.

Not to mention that it smells nasty as well.  I will never buy this again, and if I can't find anything better I will make my own beef stock.	0	2
1	B007TJGY46	A2FS9CYCWC6HLW	Coffee People Jet Fuel K-Cups for Keurig Brewers (Pack of 50) [Amazon Frustration-Free Packaging]	"ASIN B0029XLH4Y - All right, I'm going to start by saying something negative about the Keurig coffee makers, which I will later explain better in my review of IT. Here goes: this coffee maker makes the weakest dang coffee in the history of the free world. You get a choice when brewing: itty bitty cup of semi-strong brew or sort-of-big cup of brown caffeinated water. This displeases me. I bought the thing because I love coffee and would like to mainline it but cannot. Now, I've learned to live with and even get around some of the deficiencies of the maker, but finding the coffee that makes the maker look good... tough job, but someone's got to do it.<br /><br />Jet Fuel is fantastic. It makes Keurig look like the geniuses they ought to be. This stuff is strong enough to overcome the wimpy options of the maker and then some. It's not bitter, but it might taste bitter to folks who aren't hardcore coffee drinkers. To me, that ""bitter"" taste is sharp, crisp and maybe a little chocolate-like. This is the stuff to wake up to, the perfect morning jolt.<br /><br />If there's a true negative for me, it's the individual cup issue, from the ecological point of view. You get a plastic cup with a foil lid and, inside, a small paper filter filled with grounds. It is, generally, thrown away as one piece. This means that the (unnumbered) cups, which may be recyclable, cannot be put with the plastics; the foil cannot be put with the rest of the foil; the biodegradable filter and grounds not only don't go into the composter, but they'll biodegrade very slowly, deprived of air, sun and water in their little foil and plastic casing. It's possible to take the thing apart and deal with the individual pieces appropriately, but that defeats the convenience factor of the maker. Someone's got to design a better k-cup, but I can't take points away from Jet Fuel for a flaw that all k-cups share.  On the up side of the packaging, Amazon's packaging is awesome - not just frustration free, but 100% recyclable!<br /><br />- AnnaLovesBooks"	1	0

1	B0051BWU92	A2GZG363BPADYC	SEARCHING FOR A PET APPETITE ENHANCER?	"*********************************************************<br /> UPDATE:  READ THE UPDATE BELOW FIRST. Thanks. (June 15 and August 3, 2012)<br />*********************************************************<br />  I WAS, BUT NO MORE (actively anyway). We have four cats: two (""normals"") who eat about anything, one with kidney disease (CRF/CKD) and accompanying reduced appetite, and one that has picky (and weird) tastes.  In the process of trying to find an appetite stimulant for the mom-cat (with CRF/CKD) I tried out several products on her and the others (the kids) as well.<br />Here are the results of this less than scientific (or definitive) survey:<br /><br />  Drs.Foster&Smith Shrimp Snappies Treats (ground to powder)-----------ALL REFUSED.<br />  Freeze-dried powders (Prowl and Ziwi Peak)----------------------------NO EFFECT. All but one (Ms. Picky) ate them.<br />  Seafood juices (tuna, oyster, sardine, etc.)-----------------------------NO EFFECT. All but (same) one ate them.<br />  Dry (ground to powder) cat food (Halo, EVO, Blue Fuffalo, etc.)---------NO EFFECT. Ditto acceptance.<br />  Canned cat food (gourmet brands & renal diets)------------------------Ditto.<br />  Hairball tube lubes (usual suspects & Cat Grass)------------------------Ditto.<br />  Mark&Chappells De Furr-ums treats------------------------------------Ditto.<br />  Calming chews & liquid (Pet Naturals)----------------------------------Ditto (except Ms. Picky accepted)<br />  Brewer's yeast(powder)-----------------------------------------------Dulled all appetites a bit; all accepted<br />  Barley Cat (GreenFoods; powder)--------------------------------------EFFECTIVE on mom-cat; others liked except...<br />Drs.Foster&Smith Tuna Treats (ground to powder)----------------------EFFECTIVE on mom-cat;  all others liked<br />  Bonito Sprinkles (Cat-Man-Doo)----------------------------------------EVEN MORE EFFECTIVE; ditto<br />  8in1 Dingo Anchovy Fillets (ground to powder)--------------------------Ditto (effect & acceptance)<br />  Tropical Fish Food (Sergeants Atlantis)---------------------------------Ditto (except Ms Picky liked; 2 normals NOT)<br />  Purina Whisker Lickins Tender Moments (Chicken flavor)-----------------BEST (effect & acceptance)<br />  Whiskas Temptations Treats (crumbled by hand)------------------------BEST (effect & acceptance)<br /><br />Most of the products were accepted by most of our cats but their appetites were not helped noticeably until I found the last seven: Barley Cat (separate review), Drs.F&S Tuna Treats, Cat-Man-Doo Bonito Sprinkles (reviewed here), 8in1 Dingo Anchovy Fillets, tropical fish food (I did not test the ""regular"" or ""beta"" but ingredients were similar and loaded with fillers and dyes; no reason to suspect that the brand is critical), Purina Whisker Lickins Tender Moments and Whiskas Temptations Treats (only ""regular"" Salmon and Chicken flavors tested). Only the Whiskas  Temptations were effective to the point of bringing all our cats' appetites back to the ""relish"" or ""enthusiastic"" stage. None of the products were ""perfect"": most lacking in some degree of effectiveness or acceptance and the regular Whiskas Temptations (?the ""natural"" versions?) lacking in quality ingredients and difficult to crush by hand. I have avoided brands like Whiskas for years on nutritional and ethical grounds but I will reluctantly use them in a flavor enchancer role until I find a more suitable alternative. Three of our four cats had weird responses to the tropical fish flakes: our two ""normals"" were absolutely repulsed and our Ms Picky licked her bowl clean.  Go figure.<br /><br />The Cat-Man-Doo (CMD) ""sprinkles"" I bought from HealthyPets.com for just a bit less than the price on Amazon. These are the only dehydrated bonito in ""sprinkles"" form (there is a TUNA DASH product out there but more expensive) that I could find. Other bonito products typically are  large flakes and more expensive. Although the CMD product comes in a shaker jar it is not a ""sprinkles""  form like salt or pepper and does not shake out as easily or evenly; the ""sprinkles"" are still flakes, just a lot smaller. If you decide to further reduce the size of any of the products it is not necessary to pulverize them to a fine powder.  Generally they come out of a shaker container a little more uniformly if left slightly course. The Whiskas  treats, because of their soft center, are best crumbled by hand.  The Whiskas  products present the best value: about 300 servings for about $1.80 on sale at PetCo (and a bit less at Walmart). Purina Whisker Lickens come in several flavor varieties and, though equally effective, contain about 150 servings and are more expensive even on Amazons best terms (multi-pack and free shipping). Purina WL (3 oz) would have to sell for under $1 per pack off the shelf or with free shipping to be competitive. I found several of the products (DrsF&S, 8in1, Sergeants, Purina WL, and Whiskas) at a discount store (BigLots). Among the dried fish products, the CMD sprinkles do offer good value: about $2.80 per ounce (before shipping, taxes) and provide so many servings that I could not attempt to count or even estimate. If your pet gets turned on by CMD then, because of the prodigious number of servings, the CMD could be the better value. A word of caution on the CMD quantity: The listings and ads stated that the sprinkles jar contains 8 oz. NOT TRUE.  The company used a fluid ounce (volume) measure rather than a weight measure for this particular product.  The sprinkles jar contains at least 2 1/2 oz by weight. Even so, the price still beats other brands of bonito (and tuna) products that I ran across.  Credit to the company, however, since they packed the jar about as full as possible and they responded positively to my complaint about the choice of measures and confirmed that the labels, ads, and other marketing materials will be changed ASAP to state the 2 1/2 oz weight measure. Will they pack the jar as tight?  Cat-Man-Doo also is introducing a chicken sprinkles product (2 oz size).  I wonder: would our Ms. Picky take to that?<br /><br />CONCLUSION: Effective appetite enhancers are out there and probably one that matches the pickiest/weirdest of tastes.  The problem, as I discovered, is finding it.  As far as I can tell, there is no logic, no rhyme, no reason to use as a guide. Individual differences among cats seems to be the norm and consistency of preferences does not appear to be of any evolutionary value. Cases in point: our Ms. Picky.  She does not like flavors OF meat and fish  but loved the food flakes FOR fish; our ""normals"", who rarely refuse anything, were sorely offended by the same offering.  Personally, we now have reasonably priced go-to flavor enhancers for all our cats (Whiskas Temptations) and  back ups (Cat-Man-Doo Sprinkles) for all as well, even Ms Picky.<br /><br />SIDE NOTE: I powdered and combined the 8in1 Dingo anchovy product and the Cat-Man-Doo sprinkles, which suggests that other closely effective products may be mixed successfully. I did it just to use down the anchovies since they are relatively expensive and I probably would not purchase them at full retail price.<br /><br />So until their tastes change (again) we are no longer actively searching for appetite boosters.  Hope this review helps (with products or ideas) ANYONE ELSE (even dog companions) WHO IS STILL SEARCHING FOR A PET APPETITE ENHANCER.<br /><br />  ****************************<br /><br />UPDATE: AND THEIR TASTES DID CHANGE--REPEATEDLY. AND I ACQUIRED A WHOLE NEW PERSPECTIVE after trying over four dozen flavor additives over the past year. There are two approaches to re-stimulating pet appetites; ON food or IN the pet; that is, from the outside in or the inside out. I WAS TAKING THE WRONG APPROACH, assuming that all I had to do was find the right product to add to my cats' food and Valla!, problem solved! The following are my personal conclusions after many months and conversations with several vets:<br />  1) Diminished appetite may be difficult to distinguish from strong preferences (picky-picky) and preference changes.<br />  2) Normally healthy pets experience swings in appetite (like, seasonal or during hairball buildup) and do not need extra appetite stimulants or treats (although you would never guess that from the explosion of treats on pet food aisles). Even pets that play or perform only expect approval, attention and affection. Everyday pet feed should provide an adequate level of sensory interest.  If not, then find an appropriate formula (or mix of brands and wet/dry) that does. Affordability may be an issue but ""treats"" are not cheap and I have not done the math to get a fix on the  pricepoint at which treats would become more expensive. In any event, off-the-shelf enhancers/treats may have a role in case of genetic or age-related sensory loss, as a short-term aid, as a palliative after a rough experience/day, or as a ""last resort"".<br />  3) Pets with known or suspected medical issues may need the inside-out approach. Additive appetite enhancers may not be much help if the reduction in appetite is due to a medical case. The short term benefit from (even the best) appetite additives (anywhere from one meal to several months), may be long enough to keep them going while the underlying medical issues and related appetite symptoms are resolved (or not). Some inside-out Rx appetite enhancers also may only work short-term (maybe up to 6 weeks); others may work if administered continually; the best (but not typical) outcome would be a jumpstart of the pet's natural appetite.<br />  4) Pets on a special diet (like calorie restriction or Rx) have fewer choices of feed and MAY benefit from added (outside-in) appetite enhancers to even the most palatable available special diet formulas. Expect short term results and anticipate having to cycle through various enhancer products frequently.<br />  5) One reason for the loss of ""magic"" of appetite enhancers is pet intelligence:  they may eventually figure out that they can ""cherry pick"" the tasty additive and leave the relatively unappetizing food; or ""wait out"" your first offering in anticipation of tastier follow-up offerings. BUT the flavor additives work better as sprinkles and tend to lose their magic if mixed in with the food.  I found this to be the case even if I ""marianated"" their regular food with the flavor enhancer in water prior to meals.<br />  6) I have used the phrases ""flavor enhancer"" and ""appetite stimulant"" interchangeably. There probably is a substantive difference but my interest was the end result (a hearty interest in meals and increased consumption).<br /><br />For those readers who are interested in further lists of products I have tried, I set out the items I have researched/used since the last report. They are organized a little differently, hopefully in a more useful fashion.  Besides the specific items, you may find the list helpful in generating further ideas to experiment with.  Unless noted otherwise, the off-the -shelf products were crumbled or pulverized if not already in powder form. Prior consultation with your vet would be advisable if not required, for the INSIDE-OUT types and may prove helpful  before venturing even into the realm of off-the-shelf and DIY flavor enhancers.<br /><br />THE INSIDE-OUT TYPES  (do not depend on the senses but work internally, if at all, to stimulate appetite):<br /><br />  Vitamin B-12 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ Dexamethasone (Rx injectable steriod)<br />  Pro-biotics ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ Depo-Medrol (Rx injectable anti-inflammatory )<br />  Pre-biotics ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ Mirtazipine  (Rx anti-depressant pills)<br />  Exercise ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ Cyproheptadine (Rx anti-histamine/serotonin pills and  compounded liquid)<br />  Charcoal (medical/food grades) ^^^^ Cerenia (Rx anti-nausia/inflammatory pill)<br />  Pepcid AC ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ Zantac<br />  Oral Electrolytes (Non-Rx fluids like: Pedialyte, Caravet, Ions, Pets&Vets, and DIY recipes)<br />  Rx injectable Electrolytes (""Sub-Q"" fluids)<br />  Rx Oral Electrolytes (like: Rebound OES)<br /><br />THE OUTSIDE-IN TYPES  (depend mainly on the senses of smell/taste to get the attention of the appetite):<br /><br />  Hills Science Diet AD (Rx) ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^Pet Vitamins  (Sargeants)<br />  Dental gel ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^Liver (raw, sauteed; chicken & beef)<br />  Garmon VetClassics Cranberry chews (crumbled)^^^^Liver (human-grade dessicated/dehydrated; capsules/powdered)<br />  Cranberry (liquid)^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^Hairball ""treats""<br />  Beefeaters Cod (freeze dried puffs)^^^^^^^^^^^Milk<br />  Cat Milk (Whiskas) ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^Chicken (freeze dried puffs)<br />  Clinicare RF ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^Canned pet food (regular & Rx; seared/browned; crumbled)<br />  Lactulose (Foster & Smith)^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^Boutique canned food (like Fancy Feast)<br />  Spirulina (St. Jon Naturals)^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^Vienna Sausage(chicken; meat & broth)<br />  Vita Gravy ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^Pet Naturals Calming Chews, tabs, liquid<br />  Friskies Crispies ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^Mars Crave treats<br />  Pounce treats ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^JRBFoods Catty Shack treats (Walmart)<br />  ""Super"" Reds/Greens (human) powder ^^^^^^^^^^Bench & Field treats<br />  Other petmates dry food (powdered) ^^^^^^^^^^Foster&Smith Joint Care 2 (powder)<br />  Catnip (powdered)^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^8in1 Kookamunga Catnip Spray<br />  Catsure liquid diet^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^Rebound Liquid Diet<br />  Cheerios breakfast cereal (crumbled) ^^^^^^^^^^KMR (liquid)<br />  Vanilla extract (no alcohol)^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^Pet Greens (freeze-dried liver puffs)<br />  Natural Balance Platefulls-sardines (pureed) ^^^^^^My Little Lion (salmon)<br />  Natural Balance Perfect Bites (rabbit)^^^^^^^^^^ EVO Wild Cravings<br />  VetsBest Right Bites Health Management (dogs) ^^^Mixins (Variety Pet Foods)<br />  PureBites (Pure Treats Inc)freeze-dried liver puffs ^^<br /><br />MOST/LEAST EFFECTIVE Rx PRODUCTS:  There are differences; but best sorted out between you and your vet.<br /><br />MOST EFFECTIVE OF THE NON-Rx PRODUCTS:<br /><br />  In addition to the better ones (according to our cats) noted in the original list (Barley Cat thru Whiskas Temptations), add these to the BEST class::<br /><br />  Dessicated/dehydrated Liver (human grade) capsules/powder (go easy, may cause the runs)<br />  Seared/browned Canned Pet Food (regular and Rx)<br />  Vienna Sausage (chicked meat & broth)<br />  Catty Shack treats (crumbled)<br />  Natural Balance Platefulls-sardines<br />  Pet Greens Freeze Dried puffs (liver)<br />  Natural Balance Perfect Bites (rabbit)<br />  My Little Lion (salmon)<br />  EVO Wild Cravings (herring & Salmon)<br />  VetsBest Right Bites Health Management (dogs)<br />  Mixins (Variety Pet Foods)<br /><br />LEAST EFFECTIVE NON-Rx PRODUCTS:<br /><br />  In addition to the originally listed ineffective ones (again by unscientific poll of our cats): F&S Shrimp Snappies thru brewers yeast powder, add these:<br /><br />  Vita Gravy (Petsmart)<br />  Bench & Field treats (Trader Joes)<br /><br />ALL OTHER NON-Rx PRODUCTS<br /><br />  Most were accepted by all four cats but were not particularly effective as appetite stimulants in our trials. Your pets, especially the healthy ones, may respond more favorably.<br /><br />  IF I WERE STARTING OVER WHAT WOULD I DO?  (Supplementing my ""perspective"" points above) HERE ARE MY MAIN TIPS:  1) Get to know my pets' taste preferences in advance of any need  2) Check for medical causes  3) If no medical issues, switch to the other form (dry/wet) of the pet's regular food and try as a flavor enhancer topping and/or as a substitute  4) Then try  warming or browning the wet version of the pet's regular food  5) next, your best choice of a ""treat"" or supplement with the pet's favorite flavor used as a topping  6) then one with a liver taste, such as Barley Cat or Pet Greens Freeze Dried  7) Then Cat-Man-Do bonito sprinkles, Natural Balance Platefuls, Catty Shack treats, Purina Whisker Lickins, or Whiskas Temptations 8) If a product meets with initial acceptance, withhold judgment on ""effectiveness"" until after a few meals worth of experiences  9) forego trying all the hundreds of ""treats"" in search of ""the"" one that will work after you have gone thru your best shots  10) If there are medical issues, consider off-the-shelf and Rx appetite stimulants, singly or in combination  11) If a liquid meal substitute is called for consider REBOUND and CLINICARE RF, but also CATSURE and KMR and (as a last resort?) human versions of liquid renal failure products. Acceptance at this point will likely be a major issue but at least they are there for the trying.<br /><br />  My apologies for the awkward columns but I could not figure out a neat way to compress the information. Hope all this helps and Good Luck."	4	0

1	B004T3QMD8	A9NXTC0HTPSDO	Just As Good As Starbucks!  DELICIOSO!!	This coffee is DELICIOSO!  There is a wonderful froth on the top that is extremely creamy.  This coffee tastes like a pumpkin latte from Starbucks except it costs so much less!  There is just enough spice to it but it is not overwhelming.  The pumpkin flavoring is just delectable.

1	B005HG9ET0	A1QBOC76MIOJYP	Good water	Firstly, I am picky with water. I do not like Aquafina or Dasani because I think they taste like the plastic bottle. My favorite waters are Deer Park and Poland Spring. Both have a clean, crisp flavor, with no funky after taste or odd plastic taste.<br /><br />Essentia has a nice clean, fresh taste. Just pure clean water. No after taste, no odd tastes overall. I love the bigger sized bottle. I cannot attest to the benefits of drinking pH water specifically because I only tried the one bottle and of course did not see any benefits or notice anything spectacularly different from any other water.<br /><br />I suppose if you have great interest in the long term benefits of drinking Essentia with its 9.5pH and if you do not mind the price, it is worth it. I myself cannot see spending so much on bottled water, although it does have a very good, pure taste.	0	1

1	B004LOIEVS	A1PUJA2NWKA4DE	Highly Recommended!	This is my favorite thing to feed my 11 year old aussie for a chew.  Her canines have become pretty worn, partially because she developed a habit of chewing her way out of chain link kennels about 5 years ago (which I no longer keep her in) but also because I used to give her very hard chews when she was younger.  I still give her a chew in the evening but it is always something pretty soft.  I like the Sam's Yamz but they are pretty pricey and then I found these!  I purchased my supply from Amazon which is perhaps I didn't have the same experience as the previous reviewer with them being pretty hard. The pieces in the bag I got were very soft and chewy.  With free shipping these are a great deal and don't wear done my dog's teeth!	0	0
1	B000H27K86	A2L1MZYH5U1P91	Fantastic Catfish	I, just like all the other reviewers love this seasoning. I have been making Cajun Catfish with this seasoning for about 15 years. I have tried other seasonings when this one was not available, but it's just not the same. If you want to try my recipe, it's very easy. I melt butter and brush the catfish fillet with it and generously<br />coat the fish with the seasoning. Meanwhile I preheat a cast iron skillet. When the skillet is hot I put in about 2 tbs olive oil and than about 3 tbs of butter and fry the fish to a golden to dark brown on each side About 4-5 minutes and add some more butter if the pan becomes to dry after turning the fish. During this I make a pot of spaghetti, my wife likes angle hair, after the pasta is done, drain it and remove the fish to a platter, turn off the heat under the skillet, add a little more olive oil and butter, scrape up the bits of fish left on the bottom of the skillet and dump the pasta into the skillet and mix it around to soak up the buttery oil, than sprinkle some more seasoning on the pasta and serve with the fish. Everyone love it. To give this dish a little color, you can add a bag of fresh spinach to the pasta water during the last 2 minutes of cooking, or stir in a small can of diced Cajun tomatoes after you put the pasta in the skillet, or use both. Hope you enjoy it if you try it.	1	0

1	B000CQID6U	AGTORJGCMXRJC	Peach Black Tea	Stash's Peach Black Tea has the perfect balance of peach and strong black tea flavor for a very refreshing summer drink.  I usually use one or two peach tea bags along with 2 family sized black tea bags of the grocery store variety.  This makes 2 quarts of great iced tea, with just a hint of peach.  When I want something special I will use only the peach black tea and serve with a slice of peach.  Summer is coming so I just stocked up!	0	0

1	B000LO40AG	A1TJT6GXDGNN8Q	A Potent Hot Sauce - it should be in every kitchen. Far better than Tabasco. The 28oz is only a few cents more	"This hot sauce has become a staple in my kitchen and replaced my bottle of Tabasco. Like Tabasco - it is primarily a cayenne pepper delivery device. A few drops add a lot of heat to any dish. This is NOT a watered down hot sauce like Franks, etc.<br /><br />While Tabasco seems to impart mostly heat along with a vinegar note - this product has far more subtle tastes going on beyond the heat, yet the heat is considerable and dominates. It also lingers, on your taste buds, longer than Tabasco. There is a subtle sweetness with garlic notes to this sauce. While Tabasco can taste harsh if you add enough to a dish ---- this sauce, no matter how much you add, tastes fresh and just a bit sweet.<br /><br />I wanted to say in my review that this sauce had a hint of tomato yet there are no tomatoes listed on the ingredients. I suspect what I thought was tomato is simply the sun ripened chilies and the added sugar listed on the ingredients. But to be clear - heat - lingering heat - is the primary taste<br /><br />I like this product and I'd recommend its purchase but I'm not sure it rates 5 stars because the overall flavor does not seem, in any way, exceptional. There really is just one major taste evident and that is heat - and after that only a vague hint of something else which seems to be chiles, sugar and garlic. But chiles, sugar and garlic sure beats the vinegar aftertaste evidenced in Tabasco.<br /><br />For the $5.99 I paid locally for a 28 Oz bottle --- I'm glad to have it on hand.<br /><br />As another reviewer recommended - given the potency of this stuff - you probably only want to have a single bottle on hand. Larger quantities will deteriorate over time. I'd recommend you purchase this locally and not in the 2/3/6 packs offered on Amazon. I doubt many households will go through a bottle in a year. As I said: this is potent stuff.<br /><br />Update (July 2010) - a formal taste test<br /><br />I put 4 ounces of tomato juice into two glasses and progressively added 1/8 teaspoon of Tabasco or Huy Fong Sriracha into one of the two glasses until they both became too ""hot"" to taste<br /><br />Results: With Tabasco - with each added dose the juice became not only hotter but harsher. With the Huy Fong - it became hotter yet retained a very fresh but sweeter note"	1	0

"I love the other Nana's cookie bars and cookies, so I thought I'd give these a try even though they are ""No Gluten"" and made with rice flour instead of wheat flour. They look nice, but the texture is a bit strange (it's kind of like eating really fine sand) and they are too dry and crumble at the slightest touch. They don't taste bad, which is a plus, but I won't be buying these again."	4	1

1	B000YAH1PS	A1110JSFHN4RW4	Avoderm Is A Hit	"We recently stocked a new kind of cat food formulated especially for healthy skin and coat. We brought one can home to try out on our three-cat focus group.<br /><br />First impression by the human is that it's really a disgusting looking food. Lumps of seafood and peeled whole shrimp, in a ""fragrant"" gravy.<br /><br />It is, however, highly palatable to kitty kind. The fragrance is an added bonus for older cats since they often start to lose their sense of smell after a certain age. So a strong smell makes the food extremely appealing.<br /><br />We split the can amongst our three cats, and the vote was unanimous. All three ate the entire treat bowl, not just the gravy, but the meat as well.<br /><br />So while it's not exactly appetizing to humans, cats really love it.<br /><br />Ingredients:<br />Sardine, Fish Broth, Shrimp, Crab Meat, Sunflower Oil, Salt, Guar Gum, Carrageenan, Tricalcium Phosphate, Potassium Chloride, Methionine, Choline Chloride, Taurine, Iron Sulfate, Zinc Sulfate, Vitamin E Supplement, Manganese Sulfate, Vitamin B1 Supplement, Vitamin B2 Supplement, Vitamin D3 Supplement, Folic Acid."	11	0
1	B0040K41MY	A20FK68BUB1IVA	Good Taste, Lower Protein, Lower Sugar, Higher Price, Gluten Free!	This is a good tasting cereal with lots of nice crunch. Compared to a granola or GoLean Crunch, it gets soggy a little faster, on par with a regular flake cereal, such as Special K. But other than that, it is a nice addition to a  gluten free pantry.  I added dried cranberries, and thought it tasted good.<br /><br />We don't have to be gluten free, but we try to cut down here and there. I use soy milk on my cereal, and I'm going to compare Crunchy Vanilla Sunrise to my favorite cereal, GoLean Crunch, by Kashi.<br /><br />Vanilla Sunrise is quite a bit more expensive than GoLean Crunch. The boxes are about the same size, but one Sunrise holds 10.6 oz, while GoLean holds 15 oz, which means there was a bit of empty space in the Sunrise box. (I realize that, from the grocer's point of view, they like having boxes approximately the same size.)<br /><br />I compared amazon prices for the two cereals (which of course can change): 3 boxes Sunrise cost $0.35 per ounce. 4 boxes of GoLean cost $0.22 per ounce.<br /><br />Here's the comparison of some nutrition amounts for one cup of Sunrise to one cup of GoLean. You can compare these numbers to your favorite cereal:<br /><br />Calories:  165 Sunrise,  190 GoLean<br /><br />Sodium:  195mg Sunrise,  100mg GoLean<br /><br />Carbohydrates total:  37g Sunrise,  37g GoLean<br /><br />Carbohydrates from sugar:  10g Sunrise,  13g GoLean<br /><br />Protein:  3g Sunrise,  9g GoLean<br /><br />Overall, this is a tasty cereal and I like having the occasional gluten free choice.	1	0
1	B004JGQ16I	A3HJHV83O2U8BL	Be careful or you will get fat - or fatter :-)	"THIS IS NOT A HEALTH FOOD; but I probably didn't need to tell you that. The first ingredient is sugar and the second is palm oil. I just received and opened<br /><br />this treat and had my first cookie. If you like Reese's peanut butter cups (who doesn't?), you will probably like these. They taste almost exactly like a<br /><br />Reese's but are shaped like a cookie and have a thin cookie crust on the bottom. So, to describe it, It's a cookie crust bottom with peanut<br /><br />butter on top, then the entire cookie/product is covered in like a dipped chocolate similar to what you'd get if you went to Dairy Queen and had your vanills<br /><br />soft-serve cone dipped in chocolate.

I couldn't find it anywhere, but when I returned home to New Hampshire, I ordered some from the company directly.

1	B000DZFMIM	A1X87TMLC2TV72	Delicious	I love ginger, molasses and all of the autumn spices so when I saw these packs of 6 at the Amazon Warehouse for $8.99, I decided I would give them a try.  They are a soft chewy cookie which handled shipping very well.  They have small pieces of slivered almonds in them.  The cookies have a distinct ginger flavor.  If I could change one thing, I would add more almonds.  The almond slivers are few and far between but I am a nut lover so keep that in mind.  This cookie is aptly named as a ginger cookie. If you are not a fan of ginger, don't buy these cookies.  I think that's where some of the other reviewers may have erred. This is definitely not a cookie for people who don't like the zesty peppery flavor that ginger adds to baked goods.  The other thing that I liked about them is that they are not common.  You aren't going to see 10 different brands of these at the store, that's for sure.	2	0

This pepper is stronger and more flavorful than anything you'll ever find in the supermarket, and is reasonably priced. You can use a little less than normal if you like, since the pepper flavor is so much more pronounced than you're probably used to. But I like to use my normal amount  and thoroughly enjoy the great pepper flavor. As long as you have a good pepper mill and grind it fresh, this is really the best I've found.	15	0

-1	B0010UOGWM	A13C11C228TN5O	With a little doctoring, very good	"This is better than diet but falls short of brand name cola taste.  I feel the cola flavor is a little ""spicy"" and not fruity enough. I tried a few mixin's and now I think it is great.  If it came as good as I can mix it, I would give it five stars.  If you decide to try this product, get some True Lemon or Lime, True Orange, stevia packets (with a high level, 90% or better, of steviosides for cleaner,sweeter flavor, and a bottle of cherry snow cone syrup if you like cherry cola.  I use a half packet of lemon and Orange, 1 packet of stevia, and a short squirt of cherry per liter bottle. Now the flavor falls between generic and brand name.  Cheaper than using cans, but not cheaper than using two liter bottles.  The calorie count is about a third of normal cola.  You have to be comfortable with Splenda and Ace-K as Soda Stream uses those to offset some of the sugar (not corn Syrup a plus).  Thankfully no Nutrasweet/aspartame as I get terrible headaches from that."	0	0

1	B003FDG4K4	A3EFSLEMHNPP6A	FINALLY, Amazon offers Prime Shipping for the Mocha Flavor	I am a huge fan of Orgain; stumbled upon it a few months ago accidentally, when I was looking for an organic, high quality meal replacement/protein drink with no artificial sweeteners.  I don't like stevia either.  I love the ingredients list on Orgain- organic whey & milk proteins!!, brown rice syrup to avoid that sugar crash, and a great blend of vegetables and fruits.  I can't even tell from drinking that it contains kale, beet, spinach, carrots, and tomatoes.  The 16g of protein per asceptic container is perfect and ideally sized.<br /><br />I purchase at least 5-6 cases of Orgain a month, because I drink 2-3 a day.  At least 1 as a post-workout shake, and the others as meal supplements.  Orgain also helps me stay awake at night for evening classes, and are more preferable to consuming Red Bull or 5-hour energy drinks.  I credit Orgain (along with a healthy diet) for helping me lose weight and pursue my fitness goals.<br /><br />Big fan of the sweet vanilla and chocolate flavors, was hoping to try the Cafe Mocha flavor, but Amazon didn't offer any with Prime shipping...until now!  The coffee flavor is delicious; there's a slight coffee-ish aftertaste, but I like it.  Its flavor profile lies somewhere between the more neutral vanilla and the stronger chocolate flavors.  There's also no caffeine in the Mocha varieties.  Unlike the vanilla flavor, I'm happy to report that the Mocha flavors do not seem prone to  whey protein aggregation.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor and grab a Cafe Mocha Orgain!  Pop it in the fridge, and it'll be like drinking a nice iced coffee from Starbucks, but much healthier.  Just a final caveat; the Cafe Mocha flavor seems very popular, and frequently goes out of stock.  Buy it when you can!	2	0

1	B001E5E20O	A1XDMYX8QOW07N	An Excellent Tea	Not all Earl Grey teas are created equal. Because the bergamot oil can mask a less than stellar leaf, many tea companies do not use really high quality tea leaves for their Earl Grey.<br /><br />Rishi uses a solid leaf from Yunnan for their Earl Grey, a hearty black tea which comes from the same region as Puerh tea comes from. As a result you can easily get 2 full steeping from these leaves.<br /><br />The tea has a nice balanced flavor, the bergamot isn't overpowering and it compliments the sweetness of the Yunnan tea. Prior to the Rishi I was purchasing Mighty Leaf's Earl Grey and I have to say that I prefer the Rishi. It all boils down to the choice of tea leaves (which should seem obvious) but Rishi's choice and the price point of this tea make it THE Earl Grey to beat!	1	0
1	B0009WKASG	A3146ITFLKCGUE	Great experience	"My dog is allergic to wheat gluten.  Every other food she has tried (including other high-quality brands) resulted in itching, vomiting and/or diarrhea.  I got this food because of the limited ingredients.  She has done very well on it.  She doesn't scratch all the time, she doesn't vomit, etc.  I only took one star off because I would like this food better if it contained probiotics.  I supplement her food with a small amount of fish oil, a small amount of probiotics and a dog supplement called ""gas defense"" that helps with digestion.  Still, I am sure that even without all these supplements she would do well on this food.  If your dog has food allergies I recommend trying it.  For reference: she is a 60-pound lab and she eats 1-cup of this twice a day.  Also, she could probably stand to lose 2-3 pounds."	0	0

My coffee arrived directly from Starbucks with an April 2012 expiration date-about 5 months away.  The only improvement they could make on this product is to design a package that is easier to open.

I will caution you about one thing: store it in a double lidded tin, this one is fragrant in a good way...my frig smells so heavenly!	0	0
1	B0014WYXQK	AYQP8XMHTG2YR	Free of high-fructose	"I like soda. I definitely drink too much of it, but it's one of the last I-know-how-bad-it-is-for-me things I allow myself in a time when most of the foods and drinks you see in the supermarket can best be described as ""mild poison."" Books and documentaries keep popping up telling us just how bad the foods are that we consume (Supersize Me, Fast Food Nation, The Omnivore's Dilemma, etc.), and one of the big offenders is the insidious high fructose corn syrup. They put it in everything, it seems, especially beverages. (Its worst aspect is that it blocks the receptors in your brain that tell you you're full and should stop eating or drinking, so you continue feeling hungry and eating and drinking more and more.) So it's refreshing to have a drink that's got a nice sweet flavor without this awful sweetener. Tastes will vary, but I found this pretty nice, and pomegranate's a flavor you don't normally see as a soda - or, ""sparkling juice"" - so I'd say this is worth a try. At the very least, it's more interesting than another boring ol' cola or lemon-lime soft drink.<br /><br />A note on the Clementine variety:<br />These Izze drinks are really quite nice. In addition to the lack of high fructose corn syrup, which is a major plus, they use really interesting flavors. This clementine flavored sparkling juice is cool variation. I thought it might taste more like a Sunkist-style orange soda, but it really doesn't. The clementine flavor is very distinctive. I don't think I've ever had a soda quite like it. Tastes great, very tangy, not nearly as sweet as I would have expected. A nice, cool drink for the spring.<br /><br />A note on the Grapefruit variety:<br />Much the same as the others, this is a nice change of pace for a fizzy drink. This is my wife's favorite flavor, though for me it's got a little less zest than I would have expected. Still, it fits nicely with the other flavors."	2	1
1	B000EQX57K	AF7DZ97VNSEWN	I agree with Richard, an excellent find	Do without the salt.  These chips are great, and you can taste the excellent unique blue corn.  This company is very savvy, so that these chips are also very healthful for other reasons.  I eat some about every day.  They are really irresistable, so I like the healthful aspect.  Be careful not to eat too many!<br /><br />Regards,<br />proclus<br />[...]	0	0
1	B003FDG4K4	AN02DZR41K0N0	Best in Blender with Fruit	Orgain Vanilla just about beats all the competition with one exception: the taste. For a high protein drink that is organic, whey-based, and contains the equivalent of 10 fruits & vegetables, this should be no big deal. I would describe the taste as a mildly sweet drink that has the body of 1% milk. It also contains solids that tend to pool near the bottom of the container (great looking packaging, BTW). However, if you put the drink in a blender and throw in a few raspberries or strawberries, it really improves dramatically. Try it and see!	1	0
1	B0051COPH6	A3A7Y3TSPPZU9T	Exceptional, High Quality Baby Food	Baby Gourmet really is exceptional, high quality baby food.  It is delicious too (I ate a pouch!).<br /><br />The fruit and vegetables are totally organic, which is nice, and the ingredients are pure with no fillers, sugars, starches, fats of any kind added.  Only pure organic pear, organic broccoli, organic spinach, vitamin c, organic lemon juice concentrate.  You can't do much better than that.  I also appreciated the BPA free packaging.  This product is free of common allergens for baby like dairy, egg and lactose.  Gluten free as well (nice for moms for who have celiac and wonder if baby is intolerant as well).  No need to worry.  There is no gluten at all in this product, which leaves me to believe it was manufactured under gluten-safe conditions).<br /><br />Highly recommended if you're looking for a superior baby food brand.	0	0

1	B00507FBQQ	A38RWVWOQPYJSA	A New Favorite!	I love Matcha and I love licorice, so this flavored Matcha should be a no-brainer, right?  But to be honest, not all licorice flavors are done right, and it's one of those flavors that if it's not right, it can be just WRONG.<br /><br />Fortunately, Red Leaf Tea did licorice RIGHT!  This is a strong, crisp, zesty licorice flavor.  It's really an exhilarating flavor.  As I sip it, the aftertaste reminds me very much of Altoid's Liquorice which is the strongest licorice flavored thing I've ever tasted.  This nearly rivals the Altoids in strength ... but this is even better because of the Matcha.  The Matcha offers its creamy consistency and slightly buttery, sweet vegetative tones to the sip, which softens the sharper notes of the licorice in a very appealing way, creating a flavor that reminds me of black Jelly Bellys ... as if someone took black Jelly Bellys and liquified them and stirred them into a bowl of Matcha.<br /><br />It is so good.  If you like black licorice, you should try this.  If you are a black licorice fiend like I am - you've GOT to try this ... this may just be my new favorite source of black licorice flavor, not to mention my new favorite flavored Matcha!	0	0

I put mine in the fridge but doubt if they will be around long enough to get stale.  The peanut butter and crisp cookie combo  is hard to resist. If you love peanut butter don't miss out on this treat.	0	0

But then I looked twice on the name, it mentioned ""'mini' ceramic vases"", it doesn't matter, the plants arrived in great shape, the roots were still a little wet so they wouldn't dry out during shipping.  The pots are cute.  The seller emailed me to instruct on how to maintain the plants.  I killed some plants before, but I also get to keep some alive.  I hope I can have these bamboo for a long time.  I recommand this seller."	0	0

We used to buy them at the Dollar General, but cannot find them there, or any place else, any longer. These are the only treats that all four dogs will eat.

1	B0073I282U	A3VSA64KDKWIA0	Delightful, High Quality Extract	"The previous reviewer is clearly confused.  An ""extract"" is the essence of the plant or fruit (orange, in this case), mixed with alcohol.  No alcohol, no extract.<br /><br />That said, this extract is excellent and an astonishing bargain at its current price of $6.99.<br /><br />The aroma is pleasant and, not surprisingly, smells just like oranges.<br /><br />It adds delightful orange flavor to any dish.  I made lemon poppy seed bread for Christmas and, instead of putting all lemon extract, put half lemon and half orange extract.  Every single person who ate the bread said it was the best they ever had.<br /><br />Don't be fooled by the confused and uninformed reviewer, this orange extract is excellent."	2	0
1	B006MONQMC	A2R1HUYHXV7H18	Good alternative energy drink	I like that this has sucralose and not nutrasweet in it.  It takes one squeeze to flavor a glass of water.  It has several vitamins, specifically focused on energy - like the B vitamins, and it contains caffiene.  I much prefer this to the little vitamin drinks, and it is a better deal.  I like that it is zero calories.  The taste could be a bit better, but really, no energy drinks are all that good, and I feel better if my teen wanted to drink some of it occasionally than the other brands of canned energy drinks that I see his friends with.  I think it's good that you get the water with it - a lot of times a bit of hydration, aka water, is an energy booster in and of itself, and helps you think better.  It's a generous sized package in a handy size.  There's a lot to like about this, but I'd try some of the other flavors.  This one wasn't bad, but it wasn't exactly what I'd call good - it's a long way from a real punch juice drink, but it's drinkable enough to down pretty fast when you need an energy burst.  I wouldn't use it as a regular water enhancer though.  I'd rather just put some mint or juice in my water if I wanted that.	0	1

1	B000CQC08C	AMPPPNBMRAEBF	Stash Premium Green - The Best Of The Best	After trying about 30 different brands of Green Tea, I have found this to be the best tasting. This Green Tea is a blend of Japanese Green Teas, which are more robust and flavourful than typical Chinese Greens. The only Green Tea I've tasted that compares is straight Yama Moto Yama from Japan. I believe Yama Moto Yama is also in the Stash blend.<br /><br />As far as Green Teas go, this blend is among the naturally sweetest and has no bitterness... unless you overcook it. The trick I have found to getting the best flavour from Green Teas is not using too high a temperature to steep it. Steep at a lower temp (170F-180F) for a longer time which will result in a tea that is actually green in colour, not brown or gold. Also, this tea tastes best as is, don't put any sweeteners in it like sugar or honey. If you are addicted to sugar, ween yourself off of it and enjoy the great flavour of this premier Green Tea.<br /><br />Of course, Green Tea is incredibly healthy, rich in anti-oxidants and relaxing theanine, is not harmfully acidic like coffee and there is also one quarter the amount of caffiene than in coffee - easier to brew too!<br /><br />The price is quite reasonable considering the quality of tea you are getting. Better yet, buy it in bulk for great savings.<br /><br />If you want to be even healthier, Stash also sells their Premium Green Tea in organic form for only a few more pennies per bag.<br /><br />Enjoy and be healthy!	18	2

1	B000OU5EFW	A1CWMEQBBRO7QQ	Lunch Time Special	"I have been purchasing things from Amazon for a very long time.  I have never felt the need to review anything, let alone when I buy it from somewhere else.  However, I stopped in to my local Walmart today, looking for something to accompany my 6 pack of wing-dings.  After coming off of Memorial Day weekend and going to a couple of barbecues I needed a break from chili.  My coworker who accompanied me to grab lunch looked at me like I was an insane, but that did not sway me from grabbing the Tamale's and heading back to the office.  Upon first bite, it was as though a small village in Mexico had occupied my mouth during the Cinco de Mayo festival.  I was expecting very little, but the gelatinous corn meal shell and suspect ""beef"" stayed true to the Taco Bell taste I have grown accustomed to.  I gave this 5 stars, because in the can I got 5 Tamales and only paid $1.50."	2	1

This bag is great value compared to buying the smaller size shakers with different colors. I can use two of containers of  those colors on one batch of 24 cupcakes.  I just have to find a proper container to put the bag ones in so they are easy to shake out onto cupcakes, as that is what I use them for mostly. I'll check on amazon to see if I can find an appropriate shaker.  I may just buy a smaller one (about 10 oz) shaker and use and re-use that one.  My son and I like them also on ice cream, topped with ready whip canned cream. Gives pleasing texture to  ice cream. Yum!	0	1
