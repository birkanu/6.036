		A1DJ9FOEOA0WF1	For more than salting foods.	Yes, I do use this product for salting some of my foods, but it also has another handy use. Because the grains of salt are much larger than normal, I use this salt to clean my cast iron grill and skillet. I pour one or two tablespoons of salt on the slightly warm grill or skillet, and rub the salt into the bottom and sides of the pans with a wadded up paper towel. The salt even quickly makes short work of cleaning the RIDGED bottom of my cast iron grill pan. Works perfectly. I usually keep two or three packages of this product on my spices shelf because I use it frequently both for salting food and cleaning the cast iron.	16	2
		A21NBMOERHFKNH	Decent Aged Balsamic	Spend a few more bucks and get a higher quality aged balsamic. It was way too thin and had a bitter bite for an aged balsamic of this quality. Spend the extra bucks and get yourself a bottle of Rubio.	0	0
		AEMZRE6QYVQBS	three empty dishes can't be wrong	My two Rhodesian Ridgebacks and one Labrador Retriever are no pushovers.<br /><br />Even other varieties of highly regarded Canidae food have left them looking up at me over lightly rearranged bowls of food with that 'Why have you turned against us again?' look.<br /><br />But whenever I bring home the thirty-pound bags of Canidae Chicken Meal and Rice, the dogsters nose hungrily around the car before I can even get the stuff out of the trunk. I've long since settled on Canidae (for its reputation as nutritious and high-quality) and on the Chicken Meal and Rice (for the predictability factor with my threesome).<br /><br />Things just got better, however, when I realized that my Amazon Prime membership allows me to order a thirty-bound bag for second-day delivery at no cost (in fact, it usually arrives the next day) at a price lower than what I was paying locally.<br /><br />This has allowed me to move to a just-in-time delivery service, which cuts down on the storage needs and may be attractive for other owners of multiple and/or large dogs.	0	0

		A24PH6RGFDHXHU	Greenies never has clear description	"hello,<br /><br />i don't care if it's manufacturer's or Amazon's description, but it's weak. 1, you can't blow up product picture. 2. description is inconsistent. sometimes it states quantity in box, but most of the time, it does not, as with this size ""petite"". by the way, can someone tell the manufacturer it's bad french, there's no ""e"" at the end?!<br /><br />thanks"	1	23
		A68CSKRK4XJBX	Great raw food alternative	These patties are great for traveling and emergencies. My dogs are fed a homemade raw diet but I keep a bag or two of these on hand just in case. They also make a great occasional treat since the dogs love them.	0	0
		A3VSO43VH3H0AT	Tasty	These chip/crackers were very tasty... however people who have allergies or problems digesting corn - like me - need to beware. If you just read the front of the packet it seems as if they are made without wheat or corn. Not true, the main ingredient is corn.	0	0
		A39UOHD8VNRYHB	These Cookies are the BOMB	I tried these cookies a few days ago and they were so delicious. I always bake with Almond flour and it was a real treat to find cookies made with Almond Flour and so darn good! You must try these...you won't be disappointed if you are a Almond Flour lover like I am! :)	0	0
		A2PDDZ7EFLJHAD	Great Mommy Afternoon Pick me Up!	I received a free sample of 5-Hour ENERGY® from Smiley360. I have never tried this product before but had seen commercials of the product on tv.  I am a busy mother of 4 daughters (ages 6, 5, 3, and 2).  I have a very full schedule and as most moms know the afternoon hours are just when I start dragging.  Maybe a nap is what I need, but no time (literally!).  So I tried a small bit of 5 hour (half a bottle) just to see how it would go when I hit that afternoon drag-- and yep it was just what I needed to complete my day.  My mood is good, my energy is still on the go, and I am not dragging just struggling to make it through dinner and bathtime and the wonderful thing is no headaches.  This is a huge help to me and I am so thankful to 5 hour for this aid to my day- and yes it has made it on my grocery list!  I hope others find it as helpful as I have!	0	0
		A1ETUWCY1JHJ42	French Vanilla Mousse	This is a good easy sugar free dessert.  Served alone or over a few fresh berries it is very good.  I will buy this item again.	1	0
		A18P55KFS6AZFC	LOVE this gum	I LOVE this gum.  I prefer sugar-free gum and am not able to eat aspartame.  That leaves me with few choices.  I tried this gum several months back.  Now I have to order it by the largest container available because I chew it all the time.  The flavor is great.  No weird aftertaste from the xylitol.  The flavor lasts a long time as does the texture which is often a serious problem for sugar-free gum.  They make smaller packages if you are just trying for the first time, but you will wish you had bought the larger size as you will be addicted like I am.	0	0
		A1AVLKAXW55QQA	Spicy but good	If you like spicy, then these are for you.  I like spicy, so I enjoyed these.  They're also crunchy, as kettle-cooked chips should be.	0	1
		A9NXTC0HTPSDO	My Picky Cat LOVES this food!	"I was advised to try this food by a worker at Petco when I was having difficulty finding wet cat food that my cat would like.  His wet food 3oz per day would sit in his dish for hours with him only touching a little bit of it.  It was a total waste of money for me.<br /><br />At first I was questioning the quality of the food because it was set in between the cheaper low supermarket brand cat foods instead of it being placed near the higher quality foods like Wellness, Natural Balanace, Blue Buffalo etc.  The worker said.... ""just try one 3oz can and see if your cat likes it.""  I looked at the ingredients and it looked like a pretty good food list.  I give my cat a dry combo of Nature's Variety Rabbit Food with Blue Buffalo adult so I know he is getting great dry food in his system so I wasn't too worried about the wet not being up to the level of the dry as long as the food wasn't full of crappy stuff.<br /><br />Well I gave him him the Shrimp flavored one first the other day and he literally ate it in 3 or 4 minutes without stopping to take a break.  I then went back to Petco to buy some more Shrimp and figured I should just try all of the flavors.  Well, there wasn't much to choose from.  Apparently cat owners are getting told about this wonderful food and the stores are running low on it.  I picked up the Chicken & Pumpkin(gone in 3 minutes again yesterday) as well as the Tuna in Gravy ( ate it this morning in less than no time) so I am really glad the Petco worker suggested this food for me.<br /><br />The foods come either in a gelee or a gravy.  My cat loves both of them.  I hate to tell more cat owners about this food in fear that the shelves will be completely empty when I need cat food but I just couldn't help spreading the good news about this new food I found.<br /><br />I would not hesitate trying this food.  It seems to be a winner in my house!!"	1	0
		ANQZZKNA5HKJN	I haven't foung anything better.	I have tried both the sweet and spicy, and the peppered. Of the bags I have tried so far, all have been exceptionally tasty. Great flavor and texture. Have yet to have a piece with any nasty chewy fat like you get in every bag of Jack Links.	0	0
		A1PRAQGIYUAGCM	Great product and service as always...	First time I tried this.  Ordered it for a friend who has trouble sleeping.  She said it helped.  I will start on it as soon as my current supply of magnesium citrate is depleted.  Gread product and service as always...	3	2
		AWFI7DXIJ4A8R	The Best Thing Since Sliced Bread!	I first had Udi's white sandwich bread at a restaurant.  I spit it out because it was so good that I was sure they must have screwed up and given me regular bread.  But they hadn't, and thus began my love affair with Udi's bread.<br /><br />My husband doesn't have celiac disease but he still loves this bread.  The only reason he doesn't eat it all the time is because of the expense.<br /><br />The ends/heels of this bread can be hard so I grind them up in my food processor and freeze them for later use in recipes that call for bread crumbs.<br /><br />Highly recommended!	3	0
		A3OMKFBTE9YMGR	Wonderful Peach Flavor	I love the flavor of peach tea, but finding it can be quite a problem.  Now, I can serve it anytime.  I add the sugar free peach syrup and some lemon to a pitcher or glass of tea, and everyone is happy.  The flavor is marvelous - not too sweet or too tart.  I love all of the Torani flavors, but peach is the family favorite.  It also works well on ice cream, yogurt, even scones with cream cheese.  The delivery was fast and the product was well packaged.	0	0
		A3NTY6DQW4P8KH	SO STINKY- DOGS GO NUTS!	Our vet sells these so I grabbed them in bulk.  My dogs go insane for these little treats.  I personally believe it is because they are really smelly so it gets their slobber going!<br /><br />My best advise is to take them and shove them into rawhides or other items that you want a long chew.  Great bang for the buck, 2 of these little treats shoved into the ends of rawhide rolls gives both dogs a good 45 min of chew time.<br /><br />They make a cat version too that our cats totally dig.  BEWARE- these kind of treats must be locked up or they will be eaten.	1	0
		A3MDETK0D5UAIN	Nasty Taste! Make You Gag!	This stuff tastes so nasty I wanted to gag. The aftertaste is hard to get rid of. I am not a diet soda drinker but this reminded me of the aftertaste from diet drinks. I tried mouthwash and brushed my teeth but it still lingered and made my tongue feel raw and my teeth gritty like it was taking  the enamel off.	0	1
		A1N655X9X7C6QY	LITTLE PRINCEY LOVES IT !	"I'm giving this 5 full stars. because my little Princey LOVES this food.<br /><br />I change my dogs' diets periodically and they let me know if its a winner or not--right away.<br /><br />Little Prince whos' a Maltese by the way --is very picky  and can tell right away if it smells good and if it tastes good...and if he wants to eat it.<br /><br />He went to this food immediately AND began to eat it without a long  major sniff test first.Just one look was all it took...and he was chowing down.<br /><br />Prince is only fed the best foods--so he knows what good smells like.<br /><br />But this food--sadly--made him want to eat--smelled great to him---but this food is the "" Big Mac ""  of Dog Foods.<br /><br />First ingredient is BEEF and then SOYBEAN MEAL and ANIMAL FAT.<br /><br />This is not the ingredients of a top notch food..<br /><br />It tastes good and smells good and the dogs will love it....but Little Prince will only be getting a bag of this  maybe once a year if that.<br /><br />Just NOT enough nutrition for him in the ingredients."	1	1
		A39WWMBA0299ZF	Yummy Energy Candy That You Can Easily Carry With You	"Ambrosoli-Honees Energy Plus Vitamin Caramel ""drops"" are really more like candy. They are hard and rectangular. The outside candy has a nice caramel taste. The inside is a gooey, liquid and delicious honey. They are really tasty and I found that they did give me a decent amount of energy and did not make me jittery. I tested these drops out on a day when I only had two hours of sleep. I had one drop in the morning and one a few hours later. The only caffeine I had was in the form of some diet tea. They definitely helped me to stay awake.<br /><br />One package contains 9 ""drops"". While the serving size is 1 piece, three drops equal 100% of your daily value of Vitamins B6, B12 and C. While this may be a great way to get your vitamins and energy, they do have a down side. Each piece contains 5gm of Carbs and 5gm of Sugar. I really hope that they make a sugar free version of these in the future because they are great other than this. The drops are also caffeine free.<br /><br />Ingredients: Sugar, Corn Syrup, Milk, Honey, Butter, Natural Flavors, Vitamin B6, Vitamin B12, Vitamin C. **PLEASE NOTE THESE DROPS CONTAIN MILK. IF YOU ARE LACTOSE INTOLERANT, YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO TAKE THEM**<br /><br />I love that I can toss these into my purse and have something with me that will really give me energy. As long as the carbs and sugar are not an issue for you, I highly recommend them. One pack will last you 3-9 days depending on how often you take them, at the current Amazon price (10/25/11), they are a little over $1.15 for a pack of 9. So, they are also a cheap way to get energy.<br /><br />PROS:<br />*great price for an energy product<br />*great tasting<br />*they give you a decent amount of energy<br />*you get 100% of your daily value of Vitamins B6, B12 and Vitamin C with 3 drops<br />*highly portable/small<br />*No caffeine or harmful additives<br />*May take care of your sugar fix and give you motivation to get off your booty at the same time :<br /><br />CONS:<br />*5gm of sugar each drop<br />*5gm of carbs each drop<br />*Hard on your teeth since they are hard candy & sugary"	0	0
		A18ML94Q2GHJL5	Great tasting gum	I was interested in trying out the Stride gum---it's really great.  The flavor changes from one fruit to another.  I like Stride because the flavor does not fade a way quickly---it lasts and lasts.  I recommend it highly.<br />I ordered it through Amazon and it was shipped to me in a short time-- which pleased me.	2	0
		ALJF9BX26OBV4	Just meh, nothing overly special	I had such high hopes for these but, as another reviewer noted, they taste no different than store-bought maraschino cherries.  As an added bonus for the store-bought variety, you don't have to wait very long to enjoy them, whereas these will take a couple of days to be processed and even more time before they arrive at your door.	2	0
		A30TWWSW3PEPS6	Pleasantly Suprised!	"After reading numerous reviews on these beans from JRmushroom and debating on whether or not I really needed them, I finally decided to just go ahead and order. At my local grocery store 1 woody, dried out bean is $7.99! These beans arrived 2 days after I ordered them and the quality is amazing. All of the beans are 6-8 inches long, juicy, plump and full of seeds. They have oily skin (as vanilla beans should) and the aroma is divine. I made vanilla bean cupcakes and vanilla bean ice cream and started homemade extract(half of this pack, about 22 beans). These beans are perfect. I can't believe the quality for the price. If you are debating, go for it. You won't regret it!<br /><br />******UPDATE*******<br />I am still just as pleased with these beans as I was when I first got them. After 3 months of maturation, my homemade vanilla extract is excellent! Dark brown and slightly ""syrupy"" and it will only get better with age. Total price of the beans used in the extract (22 whole beans, split ~$10.00) and the alcohol (smirnoff vodka750 ml. ~$9.00) just under $20.00 produced an entire quart/32 ouces of fantastic extract and seeing as the ""pure"" vanilla extract in my grocery is about $6.00 per 2 oz. bottle the savings is tremendous. I would still be saving a fair amount if I purchased vanilla in bulk (like at Costco.) It is simply a win-win."	26	0
		ABO82IA37014J	Yep, They Changed the Formula...	This cereal has changed for the gross.  I didn't buy my latest can on Amaon, rather Target, so it's obviously a Happy Bellies issue & not Amazon.  The color of the cereal is a nasty grey/green and it smells awful.  I was wondering why my babies weren't really that enthusiastic about eating.  I like the added DHA & probiotics, but looks like I'll be going back to Earth's Best Oatmeal cereal.  Another company trying to skimp out on high quality ingredients, just to make a quick buck.	0	1
		A1K69BBLY0NVOW	Good dietary supplement for an older person...	I worry about my mom not eating enough, and these are similar to a candy bar, but full of protein.  It's a great item for the fussy eater.  I ate one myself, and though the filling is a little powdery, it's quite tasty.  I just wish they'd mix a variety of flavors in the bulk box, but I would definately order again.  Price is quite reasonable.	1	0
		A1M36LA2KC8LZ8	THESE ARE *NOT* K-CUPS!	Come on, Amazon - correct the description for this product or correct the search feature so these don't come up as K-cups. I'll go to Bed, Bath and Beyond for these... and maybe the rest of my K-cup needs as Amazon just isn't getting the job done here.<br /><br />(And yes, before the trolls start in on me for not reading, I understand I should have read every word on the page - but honestly... who has time for that, lol?)	0	1
		A1ZO8U6TXO2UA6	I Love the Pomegranate Tea	I started drinking Bigelow Tea a few years ago when I gave up drinking diet soda.  This tea is so good.  I love the Pomegranate flavor and the little caffeine boost as it is Black Tea.  I also bought the Pomegranate Green Tea and make a big mug using both.  Really good.  6 Boxes.	0	0
		A1FNCMOQ86GPHY	Great snack for on the go moms!	I loved this!  I am a vegetarian and a mom that loves to have something in her purse for weak moments!  This totally fits the bill.  I looked on the Primal Spirit website before ordering to see the differences in nutritional content between all of the flavors and I was surprised that there was quite a difference.  I ended up choosing the Texas Barbecue because it equaled 2 Weight Watchers points and was the lowest in calories.  They are definitely pricey but in my mind totally worth it.  A lot come in a box and they are a great snack to carry with you!	1	0
		A3MTP53DCCF87N	Caveat Emptor, All Over Again	"The Product Description on Amazon's web site says: ""Small granules of dehydrated California garlic with the intensity of fresh garlic.""  The label on the product itself says ""Product of China""  The fact that the product label also says ""Packed in USA"" fails to mitigate what appears to be deceptive advertising.  I'm not going to fool with this any more; Lord knows what's actually in the bottle.  It goes into the garbage.  Henceforth, unless Amazon states clearly the Country of Origin, I'll pass on their products."	3	4
		A1W415JP5WEAJK	Perfect for Bread Machine	"The first time I use a recipe in my bread machine, I always check to see if it needs adjusting. This one did not - it was perfect the very first time.<br /><br />It made a wonderful loaf of bread which raised very well and had a good texture. It was very moist and very light. I used the 1 1/2 pound setting on my 2 pound machine and set it on light crust. From the amount of raising I had, I suspect a 1 1/2 pound machine pan MIGHT just be a bit too small for this particular bread.<br /><br />What I love about it is the fact that even though it is white bread, it uses unbleached flour, making it healthier. In fact, the ingredients on this mix are all healthy choices ...<br /><br />Here's the ingredients:<br />Unbleached and enriched flour (wheat flour, malted barley flour, niacin, iron, thiamine, riboflavin, folic acid), sugar, vital wheat gluten, soy flour, salt, and Vitamin C. The enclosed yeast is ""Fast-Rise"" yeast.<br /><br />I not only would recommend this to a friend, but have already sent some to my daughter."	0	0
		A2R9RLT7XWRC3	Miracle Dog Food	I cannot say enough good stuff about this dog food.  I've been using this dog food for over 10 years and it has been difficult at best to find.  I'm so glad to see it on amazon!<br /><br />My 8 yo 50 lb. mutt was showing signs of age, sleeping a lot, and basically not much else.  My vet asked what I fed him and I told him Science Diet.  He said - well that's a good food.  I was then turned onto this food (for my 65+ lb lab) and I noticed an enormous difference in my mutt.  He became the fun active dog I'd always known him to be and basically stayed that way till he died at 15.5 years old.  I totally attribute his activity and long life to this food.<br /><br />My lab was always active so in all honesty I did not notice any changes in her.  The food is dosed with glucosamine and chondroitin for healthy joints - which is a nice to have when you have larger breed dogs that sometimes have joint problems.	1	0

		A30MZTTFXOG5FI	Gluten-free flour	My daughter can't eat anything with gluten. She was feeling bad because she loves fruitcake. I made some using this flour. I tasted great; almost impossible to tell that it did not contain flour. The only problem is keeping the bread from drying out by the next day, even in the case of fruitcake which have more liquid than most breads.	5	0
		A2ZXT6MSWISDXT	Stevia Extract	I use stevia extract every day instead of sugar. This product is dependable. By the pound, it is far cheaper than the 1 ounce bottles sold in stores. I cook for diabetic people and this eliminates the sugar problem. It arrived promptly and in perfect condition. I will buy again.<br />For those unfamiliar with the amount to use - use 1/2 teaspoon of extract instead of 1 cup of granulated sugar.	33	0

		A1KMO08LPL7Y18	GUILT-FREE PeanutButter!  Who Knew?	This is a GREAT alternative to peanutbutter for those watching fat, carbs or calories.  Comparing 190 calories for 2 TBLS to 15 calories for PB2, is unbelievable.  I've even bought this as a gift for ladies working to slim down before weddings.  My husband can add as much as he cares to his protein shakes and I mix it for an apple dip.  I tastes like peanutbutter, because IT IS.  They have just pressed the fat out.  Definite staple for the shelf.  I would have given it 5 stars, but I like the PBS chocolate powdered peanut butter even better.	1	0
		A3FBKX448IBRXA	A+	"I received a mini version popcorn machine of what you would find in the theater for Christmas.  I have been trying to go ""green"" or organic as much as possible in my life.

I would highly recommend."	4	0
		A3EJ6WO2Y4KEJP	Taste, Cost and Convenience	I live in New York City and while there are a lot of cafe's selling their beans, they can be somewhat expensive and not always convenient to go to.<br /><br />I came across these beans and with the subscribe and save option, it makes sense economically.  Also, having the beans shipped to my doorstep adds convenience.<br /><br />I have a Saeco Aroma machine with a pressurized portafilter.  I am by no means an espresso connoisseur.  These beans do the job.  I make a delicious cappuccino or latte with these beans.	0	0
		A2W3MVZ6TIBM31	The Best Chicken Barz EVER!!!!	ok so i have a dachsund....hes a mini but he weighs around 20 pounds because he is very long.....he is very crazy and also very picky....about people and food lol. Well, i used to get the chicken kabobs sold by smokehouse but i recently tried these and my dog begs for them.....when he gets one he gets so excited and chews it right up.....they break nice and easy too so he doesnt have a hard time chewing them like other dog products such as greenies and jumbones. If you have a dog that you love and chrerish and he or she means the world to you?? BUY THEM THESE THEY DESERVE IT!!!!!! I will be buying and buying till there is no more of these because i dont know anywhere in MA. that sells them....best product ever and its MADE IN THE USA!!!!!!	4	0
		A1XKRZGSM21W8J	delicious smell	I keep buying the Tahitian Vanilla. It is VERY Fragrant! Everything I make with this vanilla is BETTER! My friends LOVE all my cooking. You cannot compare the cheap brand you buy at the supermarket. Life is too short to eat bad food!	0	0
		A1FS8B91NI4J3Y	Amazing product	So I've never had this before. But my girlfriend kept on going on and on and on about how delicious this is.<br /><br />After a month of searching for a way to get it here in the US, I finally found a seller on Amazon.<br /><br />So, it's very interesting. The inside consistency is that of malt balls, however, the taste is nothing like malt balls. It's a combination of honey and sweet nougat (like the inside of a snickers bar (minus the caramel, peanuts of course)).<br /><br />I really like it. I'd recommend this to anyone. It's a shame it's not sold in stores here, I think it'd do quite well	4	0

		A3HBFUNC6KKNPJ	Good Coffee in Easy-to Brew Form	I have tried the various types of Senseo coffee and like the Columbian coffee the best, followed by the Kona Blend second.  I like to make a single cup of coffee two or three times a day, and these Senseo pods are perfect for this purpose.  The coffee is very good, and the ease of preparation and clean up is ideal.	0	0

		A29ES5PXIOSU9H	good, but...	If you've never tried this chocolate before, you'll be surprised how good the unlikely combination of chocolate with a bit of grainy sea salt can taste. It is considered dark chocolate but its 47% cocoa content is less than most darks - so it might be overly sweet if you're a fan of really dark chocolate. It has a bit of a milk toffee flavor. It's good enough that it's still one of my favorites. In comparison, Ghirardelli Intense Dark Sea Salt Soiree is similar but even better in my opinion...it uses more fully-flavored chocolate as well as almond bits.	1	0
		A3QTZ4APZVX6O3	Really fast	These appeared in my mailbox, before I knew it.<br />Nice little ziploc bags filled with seeds, so I don't have to worry about a pre sealed cheap bag, and finding a container to put them in, it's already done. Very cool, I thought.<br /> Just planted them, and can tell they're fresh, by their plump, healthy apperance.<br />What I do is get some small pots, small enough for space, but big enough so, she doesn't knock it over when she eats and pulls at the  the grass,<br />Then, plant them about an inch, or two under moist/damp soil. Keep it moist, and give it plenty of light. Wait about a week or two, and it's long enough to tear off and chew, 7 inches, or so.<br /> I rotate a few pots so she never runs out. Really helps keep her healthy, and the cats love the grass!	1	0
		AM2OFTHCMHC5I	Excellent snack	As babies start to teeth they tend to want snacks like these that can be a bit more appettizing than a plastic teething ring.  They can even be a good source of vitamins for that picky vegetable eater.  Have ordered them several times in bulk.	0	0
		A2T1BMGPXVJCRI	Lighter than I expected...	I can't really say anything bad about this tea. Its quite good, but didn't line up with my expectations. I expected this tea to be a bit more full-bodied, but instead, it is a very light, airy flavor that goes well with a good dose of honey. If you're looking for a more flavorful experience, try the Sweet & Spicy variety, but if you're looking for a light, relaxing tea, this one will do just fine.	0	0
		A13H2ZRENPV9E	yum!	"The taste is the way I like ""mocha"" strong coffee and strong chocolate flavors reminiscent of a fusion of dark chocolate, milk chocolate (because of cream I added).<br /><br />There is a slight yet not totally unpleasant, bitter aftertaste on the back right side of my tongue - but not enough to prevent me from making this my morning go to coffee.<br /><br />Coffee and chocolate... yum!"	0	0

I would have thought that Wolfgang could muster up a great cup of decaf, but this is bland, boring, and no way to finish a great meal if you love coffee.

		AH9MUK2Z52V6N	Very good cherry taste, but a little too sweet	My family and I recently tasted this Switch drink (as well as the Strawberry Kiwi) flavor.  I found the cherry taste: noticeable taste without being overpowering.  My husband did not agree with me and thought the Kiwi flavor was better.<br /><br />I did find this drink to be very sweet, even without the added sugars.  It would probably be delicious in a mixed drink or with lemon-lime soda as a spritzer, but I didn't have any hand to try it out.<br /><br />Although I found it flavorful, I probably would not buy this drink, and especially not as a substitute for soft drink for the kids.	0	0

		A2HD6G443MGH2A	I gotta admit, these are great.	I first came across these while buying a variety of treats and toys for my new Australian Shepherd puppy. The lack of fillers and bad stuff, and very simple (essentials only) ingredients list was impressive.<br /><br />My dog loves these, and they have been very helpful for training purposes. As soon as he hears me open the bag, he comes and sits and waits in anticipation.<br /><br />They are slightly dry, which may account for some slight constipation, but like anything, treats should be given in small quantities and in moderation.<br /><br />My only real disappointment with these treats (and this apparently applies to all treats made by this company) is that they are made in China. While this isn't necessarily everything, if it were not for the great bullet point list of qualities these treats have, I would be looking for a US-manufactured product.<br /><br />It is my understanding (based on statements by Dogswell) that their China-based facilities are highly inspected, etc.  Hopefully, this is true, but there's no real way to know without flying to China to take a look.<br /><br />Either way, if Dogswell were to move its<br />Manufacturing to the US, and keep or even improve its standards, I would give these treats a 5+ rating, as the concept is really great, and my puppy loves them.<br /><br />Hopefully, the company will consider doing this soon.	2	0

		A3EZXHQLZXK08T	Another cup of joe...	"Wow! What an amazing deal! Thanks to the incredibly wide scope of Amazon's ""Always please the customer!"" thinking, I'm subscribing to a monthly delivery of a 5-pound bag of totally awesome fresh Dark Sumatra coffee beans (from Coffee Bean Direct Coffee Roasters). These fresh-roasted beans make an exceptionally terrific, totally smooth, rich and deliciously tasty cup of coffee, some of the very best ever. And the price is just right. With Amazon's flexible coffee bean subscription plan, I get the freshest beans exactly when I want and need them, I don't have to fret about going to the coffee store or market or running out of anything. I just grind my fresh aromatic beans before bed each night and I have absolutely fabulous hot Dark Sumatran coffee the next morning. These fresh beans are so richly aromatic that my [non coffee drinking] partner likes to grind and set-up the coffee at night just so he can enjoy these Dark Sumatra beans in his own fashion.<br /><br />Amazon.com sends me my 5-pound bag of fresh roasted beans promptly each and every month. I can suspend my order or purchase more beans, change my delivery dates and of course, I can always choose from Coffee Bean Direct Coffee Roasters' excellent stock of the very best fresh-roasted coffee beans available from almost anywhere in the world.<br /><br />I once lived in Hawaii's famed Kona coffee district and had my own absolutely fresh, just picked-off-the-tree coffee beans from my own trees, I could roast those fresh, tasty Kona beans myself whenever and however I wanted. This was a totally unique coffee lovers' experience, but Coffee Bean Direct Coffee Roasters' coming straight to my door courtesy of Amazon.com expertise is just as awesome and a lot less messy and time-consuming. I have the worlds' best coffee from the worlds' best retailer every month with absolutely no fuss.<br /><br />Please Amazon.com, find a way to stop by in the mornings, brew and serve some of my deliciously hot Dark Sumatra coffee (don't forget to wash the pot and used cup please!), that would be almost perfection. Oh, and did I mention making fresh, hot scones?<br /><br />Maybe?<br /><br />Thank you Amazon.com, you've changed the way I shop! And it's great!"	0	1
		A29SA1GYR78W2I	My dog LOVES the chicken Zuke's treats!	"My dog can be picky when it comes to treats and I always worry it's going to be a waste when I buy a new treat for her, but this product looked good and the description was in line with the kind of thing I like to feed her so I wanted to give it a try.  I don't want a bunch of filler or weird chemicals for my dog and thankfully there are a few companies out there that seem to agree, Zuke's being one of them.  In my opinion, the price is fair for the quality you receive and I never buy low-end dog treats anyway, so it seemed like a good deal in comparison to the prices I usually pay.  My dog LOVED these treats and ran to her treat jar hoping to get one ALL the time when we had some of these in there.  She ""asks"" for treats less often when it's something else in there like rawhides.  So, we both give this product 5 stars and we'll definitely be ordering them again as well as trying out the other varieties.  :)"	1	0

		A31N6KB160O508	Not bad but a little hard to get used to	My husband likes these a lot. They are a bit different to get used to as they are less greasy and salty in taste than the usual chips you buy. They are more browner than I would like to see and the chips are pretty sturdy in texture. Not bad, though. Just takes getting used to eating chips better for your health. They do have about 1/2 the calories in fat, however.	0	0
		A3NKRBAWSVGMLA	This is the tea that converted me from coffee	And I was drinking good coffee too. This is my absolute favorite tea. It's great with milk and a splash of honey. I tried other chais, but the spices were often overpowering. This one is so good I bring some with me when I travel, since restaurants rarely have it. If you like this flavor, ordering in bulk is the way to go. The cost per box is almost half that in grocery stores.	9	1

		A1R8LB1F1CV2UC	Rich cacao flavor to drink and cook	"A high quality, high taste product<br /><br />This powered cacao is different from the ""standard"" dutch processed 100% chocolate powder in the fact that it does have 25% some cacao butter. The result is that you can use it in any chocolate creation - from drinks to ganache truffles - without needing to add a fat component.<br />As the cover of round truffles it is absolutely fabulous. No sugar taste (there is no sugar in it) but a strong cacao taste, full of forest flavor and slightly spicy.<br />I highly recommend this caco and wish I could eat more....."	0	0

		A10LEFPO6N8TK3	Product was crushed, had been melted, and was stale	I won't blame Cadbury for this since the prodcut came from a 3rd Party vendor, but be careful if buying food products off Amazon, unless it's Amazon Fresh...that's OK.  Anyway, when I got the candy I opened the bag and found that many of the eggs were crushed and had melted then re-fused together in what could only be described as Cadbury Mini-Egg baseballs...which, to be fair, were pretty interesting to look at and even sort of fun to eat.  That said, the candy definitey tasted a bit old.	0	0
		A3UI1UWCOENXRD	Miracle	"I have three dogs, and one of them kept having bouts of diarrhea.  My vet gave her antibiotics and other prescription drugs to resolve the problem. These would work for about a week, and then the problem would return. My dog groomer suggested that there might be a food allergy involved.  I looked on Amazon.com and saw the ""Wellness Limited Ingredient Diet for Dogs with Food Sensitivities Simple Food Solutions"" dog food. I noted that the primary ingredent was lamb instead of corn...I ordered some and the first day I fed it to my dogs, it worked!!! My little dacshund Sugar had no more diarrhea or sickness from that day forward. I feed it to all my pets and I believe that they are actually happier now.  I am too!!!!"	0	0
		A14VLESQ6VH449	Defective!	I ordered this item, a 10 pound BAG of sour cherry Jelly Belly jelly beans but what I received was a previously opened BOX of jelly beans which were crystallized and melted together and looked nothing like the image above. In addition, the jelly beans were simply dumped into the cardboard box with no wrapper whatsoever. This box had a seal on it which had been cut through and then retaped. The external shipping packaging was undisturbed. When I have ordered Jelly Belly jelly beans from other vendors, they have come in plastic bags, shipped in a cardboard box.<br /><br />Since I really wanted what I had ordered, I was disappointed to see that upon return of the defective merchandise, I was only eligible for a refund, not a replacement as Amazon was out of stock on my item. I sent the item back and was surprised to see that today, when my return processed, there is now 1 ten pound bag of sour cherry Jelly belly jelly beans in stock. I wonder if the in stock item is the very same defective item which I just returned.	4	0
		A1ATWEANLT57YG	Great taste	Good and bad for without a bottom k-cup plastic.  Good is that like one user say, no hot water going through another plastic.  Bad, is that you need to keep the coffee in a sealed bag once you opened the factory sealed bag.  I wish it comes with a resealable bag for this.  They already save money by not using the plastic bottom half of the k-cup.<br />The coffee do taste good though.	0	1
		A1TWMVW3V1TY43	Not even a hint of passionfruit	There is not even a hint of passion fruit nor mango in this tea. One can only taste an overpowering amount of rose hips and citrus peel.	0	0
		A15USNEAJUXOSH	Quite good	I enjoy these chips. I got these instead of my usual jalapeno ones from the same company for a bit of flavor change. I think those are better but only slightly, like the jalapenos there is a great amount of flavor without being too overpowering. The small bag size prevents you from overeating as with a larger bag.	0	0
		A1ILGA7E8IAHMV	Disappointed	I just received this coffee in an order and I was very disappointed in the taste. It basically has no flavor. I really like all the K-Cup coffee I have ordered, but regret this choice. Now I have 2 boxes of coffee that I do not plan to use.	0	0
		ACELC7PJJLJGP	Great Healthy Snack	I have a senentary job, and like to munch on things. After steadily gaining weight, I decided that what I was munching on wasn't doing me any favors. Enter dried and bake dried fruit. There is no guilt if I polish off an entire bag in one sitting, although, I do try to refrain from doing so.  The Bare Fruit brand is great. Because these are baked dried, they are crunchy, like chips. And the only ingredients are apples and cinnamon. Because of the shrinkage, you can eat more than you mean to, but it is far better than eating anything artificial. Amazon's price is very competitive. I originally bought these from Marshall's and TJ Maxx for two dollars, twenty nine cents.	0	0

Unfortunately, I saved a couple to taste.<br /><br />If you like how feet, farts, and vitamins taste when licked off of an old woman, you'll love the flavor.<br /><br />If, however, you prefer your beverages don't immediately make you feel regret and a building of bile in the back of your throat, leave them on the shelf.	2	0

		A3Q4DKLN07FJ9C	Great tasting and good price	First off i am not sure what people expect. This Fr Vanilla Cap has a great taste, creamy texture and needs nothing added to it.<br />But AGAIN, i read the product info and it stated (sugar/sucralose blend)<br /><br />I use SPLENDA brand sucralose anyway in my coffee. If you do not like the artificial sweetener, then do not order this product. But do not vote it down because you didn't read the info and/or sucralose leaves an after-taste.<br />I have no after-taste from it and therefore I enjoy this product very much.<br /><br />I use this in the B60 Keurig on the middle setting (8oz if i remember correctly)<br />My Pros:<br />-Good price<br />-Creamy texture<br />-Tastes great<br /><br />Will buy again<br />For people with the dopey comments:<br />Let me add: IT IS MACHINE-MADE cappuccino! What do you think a cheap Keurig is? Gourmet coffee?	1	0
		A3UVT34TSPF5W4	Great Snack ~ Great Taste	A little harder to find than most of the other Larabars....by far my favorite.  All natural and very light lemon flavor.

		A25YCWZALU31OD	Tastes Good, not the best quality of bean	I'm a home roaster, and I really enjoy coffee. This blend does taste good when roasted. My reason for 4 stars is the quality of bean is not the best. I had to sort through it to find rocks and bad beans before roasting. This was the first time I had to do that with this company. Not a big problem, I paid less than the fancier ones. The beans roast well, but turn out less attractive than the higher quality beans. If I was stretched for money I would purchase this product again, but I would probably pony up for some higher quality beans next time.	2	0
		A13YDB1VA6XW8T	If you like grounds in your coffee	"then buy Gloria Jean's Hazelnut K-Cups.  Of the pack of 50 that came in the case, about 20 of them ""leaked"" grounds into the coffee.  Was only able to identify it before drinking if I put the cream in my mug first.  Otherwise, in black coffee we got our ""bonus"" unexpectedly.  Never again."	2	1

		A134C9GVEU5TQE	Simple and Delicious!	Try New Velveeta Cheesy Skillets<br />Chicken and Broccoli<br /><br />As a busy book reviewer, as well as a person living alone, I often select prepared foods. They save time and money in general, while recognizing that there are issues such as high sodium in such foods...so please be sure to read your Nutrition Facts on a box for full information.<br /><br />I was on Amazon Vine looking for new books to review when I spied this and thought...why not? Everybody has to eat! It had been years since I'd eaten anything with Velveeta, and had seen them advertised on TV...sounded interesting...<br /><br />The box says that prep time is about 20 minutes; I cut that down by using Tyson Grilled & Ready chicken breast strips which I already had for various uses. Interesting;y I had Fajita and I enjoyed the additional touch of flavor it added.<br /><br />Using a large skillet, sprayed with fat free oil, I heated the chicken first and then followed directions to add the pasta, seasoning and water. The pasta in this meal was unlike any pasta I'd ever eaten--it looked like rice. Since I like my pasta al dente. I kept track of the cooking time, taste testing and so the cooking time was a little less than on the box. In the past, I've gotten similar packages that required the addition of some type of meat, and I've not had any to add. In general, I've found that the flavor of the basic seasonings are sufficient and I thought the pasta and seasonings, plus the Fajita flavor was good...<br /><br />But then as the last step, after I had already added the broccoli, I added the Velveeta...<br /><br />Wow - it turned the meal into something that was delicious! I've already purchased the Barbecue Chicken to try.<br /><br />One thing--the dish is very heavy and filling so you might have some leftover...No problem! I zapped it today, after 2 days...and it was still very good...<br /><br />No, it's not home made food...but for single living or fast dinner preparation...I think you would find this a great alternative.<br /><br />Package Received<br />Via Amazon Vine<br /><br />GABixlerReviews	0	0
		A29CTSND0NYLL6	I love the item	I love the item but one egg cup was cracked when I opened the box.  It was packed well so I'm sure it's a fluke. I would still use this seller again.  I just wanted a replacement though.  However, when I went to the return area, replacement was not an option.  I hope the seller will replace this for me.  I don't want to go to the trouble and expense of sending it back.  The egg set is adorable and I'm excited to use three of them.  I obviously wish I could use all four since that is what I have paid for.  Accidents happen and I know this isn't the sellers fault.  The egg set and spoons are exactly what I wanted and are very adorable.  Love them.	0	0
		A345NW7QRCEYAL	Good value organic white tea	"I found this product at a local Marshall's and was surprised at the pricing (less than 8 cents per bag).  It is a good white tea though others used to Stash or Bentley's will need to make adjustments.  First of all, this is white tea - period. No blackberry, no acai, no mango or other additions for flavor or aroma.  Touch Organic white tea, however, is a milder version of (gunpowder) green tea (milder in color, milder in taste, but still with a smoky hint or aroma). The individual tea bags are wrapped but (unlike Stash) are not sealed in foil. Tea bags --- hence has the usual ""tea bag floating"" symptom. Water temperature to 190F,  brewing for 90 seconds delivers a good cup of white tea.<br /><br />Since I drink 6 or more cups of tea a day, I have green tea in the morning and white tea (less caffeine) in the evenings.  About two days a week, I also do ""fusion"" --- one part roobios to two parts white tea --- very enjoyable."	2	0

		A1OIKLMWZ4XR3H	AWFUL!  Total waste of money.	This stuff is horrid. It says it is Extra-Bold, but it is more like dishwater. It is so thin you can see through it and the flavor is lousy.  (Espresso is not only a strength, it is supposed to be a flavor. Not here!)  To be clear, I LOVE my Keurig machine. I use it happily with Newman's Own, Sumatra, and regular French Roast. So, while I do like strong coffee, I am normally happy with what is sold for this machine.  But now I am stuck with all these servings of stuff I am never going to use.  Even the Donuts decaf is better than this.  I buy tons of stuff from Amazon but this is the first time that I have been unhappy enough to write a review.	1	0

		A3P8OWYR65G9UF	Kettle Chips	Got these Kettle Chips Sea Salt & Vinegar (15 5oz bags) and was not impressed. Tasted kind of flat. I was eating some out of the bag, when I looked down into the bag and noticed a hole in the bag about the size of a sesame seed. Then I started looking at all the unopened bags and MANY of them had this type same hole. Some bags had multiple holes. One bag had a hole the size of a dime at the bottom of the bag like a rodent had got to it. The box they shipped in had NO holes so they we're packed this way. So much for quality control and who ever let these ship should be fired. Needless to say I'll never be eating anymore Kettle products and expect a full refund from Kettle or Amazon.<br />M.

		A1O26YWT8L3XH3	Great meat substitute!	I've been using these for a couple years now along with their other tvp products. I like the chunky texture. Really nice in chili, stew, soup, or curry.

		A3MESDJYC452TZ	great trap	I have two dogs in my back yard and I can never seam to keep the flies off of them. This year was really bad, before I got this trap they had 3 types of fly repellent on them and they still were getting over ran by flies. I got this trap because the only bad review was about the small and I was willing to try anything that was only around $6. I have to say that I love this trap when I first mixed the trap the water was green and for the first day and only got 1 or 2 flies, but after that the water turned yellow and then the flood gates opened. By the end of day 2 there were at least 100 and within about 3 maybe 4 days there were so many flies that they went able to get to the poison but still were stuck in the cup. After that the fly around my house were gone for about a week but are starting to come back. I will be getting many more of the Victor fly traps for the rest of this year and all of next.	0	0

		A2Y8IDC1FKGNJC	updated review	UPDATE: I must have gotten a bad bag the first time around. I just got another bag and opened it today. The beans were aromatic, fresh, and oily. The coffee was perfect this time around using the same amount of beans as last time. The coffee was nice and bold. It was not watered down and weak. My coffee snob husband even loved it. I ordered another bag right away. I am hoping to get another good bag. :)<br /><br />For the price, this organic coffee is good. We pay about $9.99 for half pound for higher quality for local coffee shoppe beans. Overall the flavor was full-bodied, but it tasted watered down. We used the proper amount of beans, ground them fresh right before brewing, and just didn't didn't get the zing I expected. It did have a nice aroma and finish though. the acidity was well-balanced. I might try extra beans next time. I would definitely purchase this again and maybe mix this with our regular coffee to stretch it.	1	1
		A28RHTOOW04O6M	No difference from usual splenda in taste	I like splenda and use it fairly often.  I didn't notice any difference in taste, but I don't usually make my drinks too sweet. As for the antioxidants, I wouldn't specifically buy the product for the purpose of supplementing my diet with antioxidants as I already consume them.	0	0
		A1OWRLSD7LTSQ9	KIND Nuts & Spices Bars	This was a new-to-me product.  I REALLY enjoyed it. I have been very stingy with them, eating them as a planned snack ~only~ as I could see where this bar could become an issue for me! Yes, its THAT good. I LOVE that its a more natural product<br />unlike a lot of its 'competition' that is out there. This is decent in protein, low in sugar, all natural flavors...what else could you want? A lower price maybe? If you have young kids this would be a great after school snack but it could become a very pricy one for you to purchase on a regular basis. There are several flavors to choose from and enjoy.	1	2
		A1WFTS20LOOQ9H	Fluffy and Nice	"This is a light, fluffy snack, with no oily<br />residue. It seems better than most microwaved<br />popcorn.  Salt content is not too heavy. Would<br />have given it 5*, but there is nothing like<br />freshly-made popcorn, from the stovetop, or<br />from a popper.  All microwave types that I<br />have tried leave a bit of a sensation of a<br />certain flavoring added to the corn,<br />thus diminishing a ""pure"", authentic corn taste."	2	0

		A13WOT3RSXKRD5	Makes inexpensive pies	I drain the juice and save it for fruit juice. I add 3 cups of sugar and 1 cup of flour, stir, and let it sit while preparing the top crust. I split the pineapple between 2 13x9 glass baking trays with pie crust on the bottom. Add a little butter on the top and then the top crust. Bake at 425 for 45 minutes until the crust is lightly brown. You can freeze slices and eat them later. Great snack with more fruit than sauce.	0	0
		A398R165PXFOSS	A bit acidic, but great flavor!	"This coffee is a great way to start your day! I read a few other reviews that said it was weak.  Perhaps some of that is machine? We use a Keurig and empty each packet into our re-usable filter.  My husband says it's about as strong as his other ""medium/bold"" roasts, but with a better flavor.  I would agree with that - the flavor is better than most coffees, and I can drink it with my regular 2 creams, which I can't do with ""bold"" coffees.  I only knocked off one star because of the price.  I can get 15 of these for ten bucks, or 50 of the Donut Shop Brand for thirty bucks.  If it were a little more comparable, I'd probably be willing to spend a little more for something both my husband and I really enjoy.  As it is, we will stick with a slightly more economical brand and this might be a ""treat"".  :-)"	0	1

It's sweet but not not overly sweet like cereals like ""Super Sugar Crisp"" or ""Froot Loops"" (I never have liked Froot Loops).  Rice Krispies Treats cereal tastes just like the name says."	12	1
		AA3YB5U88W9L5	Cat Sure -- Cat Saver	This product is FABULOUS!  I had a cat impacted with hairballs who wouldn't eat.  I literally squirted this down his throat twice a day.

		A32GCOTGFJ9XC3	*Quality* Product But Hard To Break!	"I love Stella & Chewy's and have been feeding their <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003BGB24S"">Stella & Chewy's Freeze-Dried Raw Duck Duck Goose Dinner for Dogs, 16oz</a> as well as their frozen raw and other flavors to my Shiba Inu puppy and she LOVES it! Ever since my vet recommended the brand for finicky eaters, I've been giving it to Monju (mixed with dry kibble).<br /><br />Anyway, STELLA & CHEWY'S CARNIVORE KISSES SALMON (the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001MQEN0O"">Stella & Chewy's Carnivore Kisses, Freeze-Dried Raw Angus Beef Dog and Cat Treats</a> are the same way) are of the same top quality as their meals. They're small, but not bite size (unless you have a big dog), freeze-dried pieces of salmon that's great for giving as treats. They have that strong fishy-scent that dogs love, so your furry child will be able to find them with no problem.<br /><br />The reason I took off one-star is because the treats are hard to break apart. Since they're freeze-dried, when trying to break into smaller pieces the KISSES will splinter and shred, which makes it hard to give a small quick bite for a reward during training. Even if you were to break them apart before hand, the treats still shred so it's hard to get small bite sized pieces.<br /><br />Also, if your pooch is able to get the whole treat in his/her mouth, it still has to be chewed, taking time away from focus, if you're using as a training aid. Other than that the treats are great."	6	0
		A3S6PE8DYG16QV	Husband loves wife not so much	My husband loves this coffee, he likes stronger coffee than I do. He says that it is very good and it must be so because he keeps on ordering it.

		A2XCUIPFLKCGA6	Great chemicals, terrible delivery system	I have been a long time user of Cutter's Backyard Bug Control but problems with the sprayer began a couple of years ago for me. The chemicals work fine and does last awhile but maybe not as long as claimed. The sprayer of a few years ago meant it was difficult to get the product out. I switched to another vendor and tried Cutter's again this year. Well, it got worse because a plastic piece of the head broke off immediately after I attached the hose and turned it on. I will not be getting this product again. Their quality control for dispensing the product is the worse I have seen for a major name brand.	0	0
		A8QYRG7TW491B	Best mint ever!	Newman's Own Organic Mints in Wintergreen are my all time favorite mints EVER! I was a frequent Trident bubble gum chewer up until I found out that it contained Aspartame and was on a rabbit hole chase ever since to find a gum replacement that could hold the taste (minus Aspartame)and not harden after a minute. I still have not found one but then I tried Newman's Own several months ago and now it is my all time favorite product. It tastes refreshing, freshens breathe, all natural ingredients and safe enough to give to my young son. This is an AWESOME little mint that is hard to find in stores, so I'm very grateful Amazon carries it.	0	0
		A27YKN5IIUEILY	Enjoyable flavor!	I got a 5 k-cup sample box of this coffee from Keureg, and I find that it is my favorite decaf coffee. It brews a smooth tasting cup of coffee every time.

		A3AWV00ZU7MSK1	Great Alternative to Potato Chips	Simply put this is a great alternative to regular potato chips.  These chips are all natural; they have no preservatives or artificial flavors and colors. Each bag brings about 19 chips and are 100 calories (30 calories from fat).  The chips crunchy and have a very light sweet potato taste.  They also have an airy feel to them - like rice cakes. I enjoyed them.  For those that are gluten intolerant, they are also gluten-free.	0	0
		A243KM5B6QCSWY	flavorful and healthful	Kukicha twig tea is one of my favorite teas. It goes further than conventional tea because it's brewed differently (simmer a teabag in a pan of water).

		A3PB88ISIGJ2AW	Okay for the price but not the best.	I have tried many different brands of gunpowder green tea and this brand is average.  Not the worst but definitely not the best.  For the price it is pretty good but I was a bit disappointed.  I had really hoped it would be better.  It's not as strong tasting as some gunpowder green teas I've tried ; some people may like that.  I would not get this item again but instead will keep looking for something better.	0	0

This is definitely a keeper!	0	0
		A3BG7KHQ27XY7F	Tasty but High Calorie	This candy tastes really good (not too sour, not too sweet) but I realized when I got it that 5 pieces are 100 calories, so it's very easy to over-eat. I ate maybe half of what I got because it's delicious, but I gave the rest away because it's so high in calories.	0	0
		A38XTOID4VG01S	Healthy AND tasty. Wow.	I'm happy to report that someone has finally figured out how to create a healthy snack that also tastes good. Once I opened the package, I literally could not keep my hand out of this bag of healthy grains. Composed of 100% whole grains and fruit, this snack is low in fat, high in fiber, and quite versatile. It tastes great by itself, mixed into yogurt, sprinkled over a fruit salad, or eaten with milk much like conventional cereal. Plus, a little goes a long way--it won't take much to fill you up. I'm pretty sure I have a new favorite snack!	1	0

		A1YUL9PCJR3JTY	Slightly Addictive Apple-Cinnamon Treat!	*****<br />These apple chips are sweet, very crispy, and yummy! They don't have the processed or chemically taste that some dried apples have. They also are not soggy at all--I like my apple chips very crispy! They are 100% certified organic, baked with no added sugar, no preservatives or chemicals, no pesticides or herbicides, gluten free, and made from Washington State apples with five apples in every bag. There are 6 servings in every 2.6 ounce bag, with 29 calories in each serving. These are a truly healthy and delicious snack.<br /><br />These particular chips are very sweet and taste especially delicious because of the added organic cinnamon. It actually is pretty hard to stop eating them!<br /><br />Highly recommended.<br />*****	2	0
		A1LLMVVFWQCL1F	The best instant ever!	Always fresh opened flavor.

		A1T16G87I5P6DE	McCann's Steel Cut Oats - Still Great...this 72 ounce packaging - Not good	I still really, really enjoy the McCann's steel-cut oats so much (see earlier review) that I decided to order the six, large 72-ounce containers this time.  The packaging is not adequate for the weight of the oats.  The cardboard tubes crushed in shipping, forcing the seals and plastic lids to come off, so I had a box of half-filled containers and oats strewn all over the shipping box.  I called Amazon to report the problem, and they replaced the order (which I really appreciated their doing, since it was a grocery product that is not returnable in normal circulstances)...and, sadly, the second order came in the same crushed, disheveled condition.  I salvaged the oats left in the containers from the two orders, so feel like my order has been fulfilled with something I can use...but won't be ordering in this size anymore.	0	0
		A1F5ZNMJV28M6X	great coffee	So far, of all the decaf Kcups we have tried, this is our favorite.  Wish it were on the automatic ordering system.  Coffee is such an individual like or dislike but when we use it with an 8oz cup of water it is great.	2	0
		A1CMUMOOH89AVZ	Suspicious taste	"I have tried dozens of these packets of snacks over the past 3 years.  Various flavors from various lots.  Some of them a while back tasted fine.  Lately, all I get are ones with a bitter, rancid taste.  Especially on the Friends variety.  Does ""all natural"" mean ""High in THC""?<br />What is up with that sharp nasty taste?  These things aren't expired.  I've communicated with Annie's on numerous occasions and have always recieved coupons for more, but I've given up on ever finding another lot of this product that doesn't taste gross.  My kids won't even eat them anymore.  Its like they are all rancid or something."	3	0

		A1804Z5697O7SX	If You Care Unbleached All Natural Waxed Paper	It's wax paper. It's made with soy wax instead of petroleum based wax. It does what you expect wax paper to do. So I give it 5 stars.<br /><br />I don't care for the packaging, which does not allow you to tear off sheets of wax paper easily. There's no strip of toothed metal or plastic to help tear off the paper -- just the edge of the cardboard, which doesn't really do the job. Unless you're in the habit of using a scissors, I suggest you do what I did and buy a wax paper dispenser to put the rolls in.<br /><br />I'd rather I didn't have to buy 12 rolls at once, but I'll get around to using them eventually.	1	0
		A282OG9GRBXNEE	French Vanilla Cappuccino	I received a sample of this with a variety pack and I love it.  I am not a big coffee drinker, prefering the lighter flavors.  This has nice vanilla flavor and coffee flavor in a creamy drink.  This makes a very tasty treat on a rainy afternoon.	1	0

I like a lot of the different Brews but this is really Rich in Flavor with a nice Body! Haven't experienced that with any of the K-Cups up to this point.

		A2ONQB6UPXHN1V	would be okay if they didnt get hard after 5 minutes	I originally bought the Zuke's Treats for Cats on Amazon.com. It arrived in a decent amount of time (I didn't expect it to be quick since I used the free shipping). My cat thought they were just okay, and would eat them if i put them in front of her, but not come running as she does for her other treats. So I would leave them out for her in her dish, and they would get hard real quick. After maybe eating 20 of the little pieces total, she stopped eating them altogether.<br />Then I went to Petco after adopting a puppy, and Petco convinced me they would be perfect for training so i got the ones for dogs. I thought maybe the shipping made them stale, and Petco assured me the ones for dogs were of better quality. Unfortunately this was not the case, my dog who eats shoes, and ANYTHHING else that's on the floor does not want to eat these. I mean they are okay but barely okay. When I take her on walks and use them to redirect her attention and they are hard by the time we get home from our walk, and she will spit out over half of them on the sidewalk. So if your pet likes hard food then they might like them (and they are real ingredients,) but if your pet is like mine, they wont touch them. I now have two barely opened packages of this stuff that just sits under my cupboard.	2	1

		A35T8A43KFWD00	Best canned peas for the price	Note: These are not like fresh peas. If that is what you were hoping for you will be sadly disappointed. Canned food in general is much softer than fresh and the colors fade over time- think pale green. That being said, these peas are, IMO, a really good substitute and great pantry staple. The peas are small but quite sweet and wonderfully refreshing if chilled, no salt or sugar needed. In fact, I have eaten them straight out of the can and prefer them this way since they are delicate and too much cooking may break them down to mush. Food possibilities? ...Think pilaf (there's a recipe on the can) or pasta salads. You really can't go wrong with the low price. I know these are not organic and I'm not sure about the origin of the cans, but they don't taste metallic like other vegetables I have tried. In fact, I've even used the water from the can. One caveat: I ordered these with the Subscribe & Save option and many cans were dented. This hasn't affected the taste or product as far as I can tell but I don't appreciate it Amazon!<br />Nutrition: 60 calories, 1% sodium, Vitamin C 20% 4g protein per 1/2 cup serving.	8	1

		A3RVMMZYOXQNKL	This product is a health hazard!	"Further info:  I took a bowl to my PCP and he told me that the excessive amount of salt in the flavor package most likely caused the pain in my chest and could very well give me physical problems such as a heart attack/stroke.  He told me to dump the remaining bowls.<br /><br />Previous comment:<br />So far, I've gone through 2 bowls.  Unfortunately, the next day (including the 2nd bowl) I get this sharp pain running up and down inside my left chest.  I thought I was getting a pre-warning that a heart attack was on the way.  I would have to guess that there is something in the flavor packet which is to blame.  And what are those gray pieces of something floating on top of the soup?  Looks like reconstituted whale blubber.  I think I will ""regift"" these at Xmas time."	1	16

		A3L768NNBH037P	This formula worked great for our lil one	"After breastfeeding exclusively for the first month, we found needed to supplement with formula. We tried all different kinds of formula- all brands and formulations, and this was the only one that did not cause the baby to be fussy and gassy (more so than what's 'normal' for a baby!). I was initially turned off by the ingredients - first one listed is 'corn syrup solids'. I didn't want to feed my baby ""sugar formula""! But after lengthy research on formula ingredients, I came to understand that all formulas have an ingredient that provides the 'energy' to baby, and while some use corn syrup solids and some use an alternative ingredient, they all break down in basically the same way in baby's body. It comes down to what your baby's body handles the best. For us, this formula was the winner. The switch to Enfamil Gentlease gave us a much calmer, happier baby. While it's not a miracle worker - won't make her sleep through the night or take longer naps - it did work as advertised for us.<br /><br />I've purchased this many times on Amazon - the price here is better than what I can get in store, even with using coupons.

		A14HXQLEP9K78L	Beware of Outrageous Shipping..	"Item not shipped by Amazon, but by a direct affiliated company...so when multiple items are ordered and Amazon quotes ""Free"" shipping...the direct / affiliated company does not have to honor the free shipping. I ordered 2 items which qualified for free shipping and was quoted and invoiced for free shipping. But when I received this $20. item, I was also charged $10 shipping/handling..  Everyone refused to honor the invoiced quoted price. I was given the option to return it ..for another $10...which now the shipping charges exceeded the cost of the item which if I returned, I no longer had...  Quite a reaming...!!!!"	0	1
		A3KH0UH99Z7J82	Better than McCann	Upon receiving the product I conducted a taste test against the accepted standard -- McCann. I prepared tow batches of 1/3 cup oats, 4/3 cup water, one ounce granulated brown sugar. Served each portion with a pat of butter and 1/4 cup of milk.<br /><br />I could tell no difference in texture or 'creaminess'. The CC, however, had a fuller, more natural taste to me.<br /><br />CAUTION: six cannisters contain a LOT of oats. I live alone and this could probably sustain me through nuclear Armageddon, or at least through global economic collapse.	8	0
		A3JHC8O59WDHFZ	I like that it's grain-free, but it's awfully expensive	I know that grain-based foods are bad for cats. In the wild, they eat meat, not wheat.<br /><br />Unfortunately, Wellness kitten food is about 1.5 times more expensive than the mainstream, grainy kitten foods, and i just can't afford to use it as my primary food.<br /><br />My cats haven't had any trouble so far with the other foods i get, so it's not that i need to buy this one to avoid investing in a carpet steamer. I'd prefer to use it more, for their long-term health, but... it's just not viable.	0	0
		A2YLDLGP5SBBYK	Good but...	Maybe my expectations were too high. Heeding the warnings about adding too much I started with 8 oz of bottled seltzer and added a few drops. The taste was more of a hint than a true flavoring so I added a little more, figuring if I got the taste I liked I'd start from scratch and get a better measurement. It never happened for me. When I added enough to create some flavor I also found an aftertaste that was somewhat alcohol-y. Not a problem for most people but I strongly dislike the taste of alcohol so it's not good for me. Played with it some more and never got a satisfactory result. Into the fridge, back of the shelf.<br /><br />A couple of weeks later I came home with some diet orange soda. Thought I'd try it again and see if I could make some orange cream soda and voila! Delicious. I say this having only tried one 8 oz serving and I made it a little too sweet but I have no doubt that once I get the ratio correct I'll add this to any orange soda I drink from now on. I'll probably try it with other flavors too altho orange seems to be the sure thing.	0	0
		A254MREUEDE89R	Best oatmeal	Bob's Red Mill Organic Oat Bran Hot cereal is the best oatmeal ever. It is easy to cook, on the stove or microwave. But best of all, is the taste it is yummy and good for you. Excellent product.	1	0
		A35R32TA60XD57	Pleases picky cat!...for awhile.	My picky cat loves these so although they seem a little pricey, I will continue to buy them.  She is so hard to please and it makes meal times much less frustrating when she doesn't sniff and walk away.  I only wish it had the vitamins for a complete meal.  Because of that I only give them to her a couple times a week.  Otherwise, I think she would love these everyday!<br />UPDATE 6-21-2012 Mabel has been eating these but all of a sudden they are making her sick.  Not sure exactly what to think but I won't be serving them anymore.	0	0

		A11ED8O95W2103	Probably great in recipes, but I just had to eat it out of the can.	Well, I just had to try canned crab meat.  I'd never had it, so I bought a can of it retail (and I decided that on-line is the way to shop for products like this).<br /><br />The meat looked and smelled fresh and was wrapped in a little cloth-like baggy.  I was impressed.  But not being a chef I just wolfed it down out of the can and it tasted like crab meat that had been soaked in water for a long time.  This is no substitute for fresh crab like the crab that's in it's shell on ice, but it's better than I expected canned crab to be.	4	0

		#oc-R11PW3CFBB4BEP	Taste= Great, Stability= Not so much	"I held off on ordering this product due to some of the manufacturing problems they had. Seems i should have waited a little bit longer.<br /><br />I order the Cyclone because i like a strong coffee but not so strong that you cannot taste the flavor. The product was dead on when it came to flavor. taste, great strength, really made a great cup of coffee, but then the astounding packaging failure.<br /><br />Went to make a cup last night and walked away. All of a sudden i was smelling the wonderful aroma throughout my living room. My thought was 'Man this is a great smelling cup of coffee."" it never occurred to me that i normally cannot smell my coffee brewing that far away. Then i went to get my cup and noticed that the coffee was all over my counter. Seems the foil top had a severe malfunction and spewed coffee all over the place.<br /><br />So in review, Great cup of coffee when it works, I hope they get the manufacturing problems fixed because this is something i would love to try again."	0	0
		A1RMUKHUTO1DIK	Hernia Inducing Cat Litter	"I used Fresh Step cat litter for many years and was quick to tell any of my cat owner friends that it was the best ""bang for the buck"" litter. It clumped hard, making the chore of cleaning the cat box a relatively easy one. Sometime around 6 months ago, that all changed. Now, it forms a sludge in the cat box that is nearly impossible to scrape out. The amount of effort necessary to clean the box could easily induce a muscle strain or hernia for those unfortunate enough to purchase this litter. Interestingly, after having this experience (twice, because I thought maybe I just got a bad batch the first time) I turned to Scoop Away which I always considered to be a similarly good product, only to find the exact same thing. What the heck? Turns out both products are made by the Clorox Pet products Co. Consider yourself warned!"	2	1

		A2TJG4N8LNJW23	One of the best k cups we've tried so far!	I really enjoy flavored coffees so when we opened the 12 pod sample pack that came with our new Keurig machine, I was excited to find a sample k cup of Van Houtte's French Vanilla. It ended up being one of the best flavors we had an opportunity to try!<br /><br />Van Houtte's French Vanilla is not quite as good as some of the french vanilla coffees I've had fresh brewed at local coffee shops, but it isn't too far off either. It's a very mild, but flavorful coffee with a smooth finish and no bitter aftertaste. I don't like extra dark coffees with lots of acidity, so of that's more your cup of tea, so to speak, this blend isn't for you.<br /><br />I will definitely be picking up more of this blend and if you're in the market for a french vanilla flavored coffee k up for your Keurig brewer, this one is an excellent choice.	0	0

		A3UNHKGHRYCWW0	Reviewers are right	Definitely a few things I agree that other reviewers noted:<br /><br />1) Small loaf - only really makes a 1 lb-er even if it gives instructions on a 1.5 loaf<br />2) Rise problems - my boxes don't expire until 2012 but I still had rise problems. A friend from the culinary school nearby said it might be because there is a lot more whole wheat in it (a good thing for the body, not as good in the bread maker). As noted in another review, baking it in the oven really did make a better and higher loaf.<br />3) Butter is best - tried oil and butter and butter is definitely better.<br />4) A little more salt - I added an additional 1/2 tsp of salt and that seemed to help with the rise as well.<br /><br />It's a great backup for when you're out of bread flour or yeast but I still think the best bread machine recipe from allrecipes.com (subbing in 2 cups of flour, 1 cup whole wheat) makes for the most delicious and closest to store bought I've seen thus far.	3	0
		A1XNHRL5TPXK6N	kids will love it	This is a great hot cocoa as long as you read the box and only use the 8oz setting on your coffee make. Otherwise it will taste watered down. Also it is an instant coffee so dont be surprised by it.	0	0

		A11ED8O95W2103	Chicken flavored salt I can enjoy anytime!	Seriously, I do like this stuff.  I hope the calories I'm saving by eating this soup sometimes in lieu of a full lunch makes up for the salt in this cheap but strangely addicting instant soup.<br /><br />Here's how it works: I arrive at work with my coffee or latte, get a coffee refill, then later rinse out the coffee cup (typically a large disposable paper cup), dump one or two packets of this soup into the cup, add hot water, and it's lunch time!  One thing I've discovered is that there's so much salt in this soup I can make it half strength -- double the water that is -- and it's still enjoyable if a bit on the thin side.<br /><br />And, the chicken heartiness soothes my caffiene wracked nerves and keeps me going and going.  Not only that, but every once in a while I even find what seems to be a little tiny bit of chicken!	1	1
		A10FRVD32VWGJ8	Different and good	Cooks up easily.  Very tasty cooked in chicken stock. I did rinse and soak overnight in an acid medium (sprouts quickly by the way).

		AGE64SY3HP9RV	The cavemen must have been wealthy	I really wanted to like these.<br /><br />First off, these cookies are about the size of a half dollar and aren't that thick. And they are more like fudge that cookies. Look at the ingredients. They are nut flour held together with honey. They need some egg or something. They are gooey and sticky. They are extremely sweet and pack a whopping 10-15g carbs each and yes that is not counting the fiber.<br /><br />I'm sorry I appreciate the effort guys but in my option these are a novetly. They are too expensive and too non-functional to be a serious part of your regular diet.	1	0
		A3FWBC0IIFG0NO	Yummy oatmeal!	This is my favorite oatmeal.  It has great flavor and texture. I cook up a batch while we sit down for dinner and then keep it in the fridge for weekday breakfasts.  It heats up nicely when a little water is added before microwaving it.  I like to eat it with a little brown sugar, pecans, toasted wheat germ and a splash of cream.  YUM!  NOTE: when cooking it ahead of time, I have found it helpful to use an extra cup of water (5 c water to 1 c oats) so it does not get so thick and rubbery in the fridge.	3	0
		A1GCFTFXELCHRP	Does not taste like Venison	This stuff tastes nothing like Venison Jerky.  The ingredients say Venison, but I don't think it is.  On top of that, it does not taste good at all.  Smells like the pupperoni sticks they sell for dogs.  Yuck.	0	1
		A2M2X6EHMLOXQS	Excellent Yeast	My only Con on this yeast is the instructions. The instructions on the packets either left out or i blindly didnt see(highly possible) the part where you leave the yeast out for 20minutes after adding it to the heated water. I looked up the website and found the yeast and read the directons there and thats where i came up with the (20minutes).<br /><br />Other then that, amazing yeast.

		A23X7VNNUT63TJ	Love them, but wish they had a 6 pack instead of a 12.	"I love the salt free blue corn chips. When I lived in Florida I ate salsa/hummus/blue corn chips for lunch pretty much every day. There was so much salt between the salsa and hummus, that I really didn't need it on the chips. When I first started with the salted chips, my mouth would be on fire after a few chips. The salt free was an awesome find, and I love that amazon sold them in bulk so that I could afford them.<br /><br />Only con is because I'm single/live alone, and going through 12 bags of tortilla chips before they expire is a challenge (natural products tend to expire quicker). I ate them after the ""best by"" date, they just ended up being a little stale. No fault of the product, just my own issue to deal with. Still 5 star product!"	1	0

		A2TXJ4ZEUAXMF1	It used to be much much better!	My family and I were Yuban coffee (Columbian) drinkers for about 25 years+.  We absolutely loved this coffee.  The price was extremely reasonable and it tasted like high-end coffee. However, roughly about 10 years ago, Yuban was sold to Kraft (I think) and they did something to this coffee. The coffee was no longer as smooth as it used to be.  My family and I no longer use this brand. I wish they would go back to whatever it was they were doing RIGHT.  Don't get me wrong; it is not bad coffee but just not what I am used to.	1	1
		A3TAF7M58DN46F	Rich & Creamy	An alternative to hamburger helper, my family really enjoyed the cheeseburger skillet meal.  For me, easy clean up and low preparation time.

		AOWF9BJDCSRFI	Pleseantly Surprised	"Admitedly, I can be closed-minded when I see food with the words ""sugar-free"", ""low-carb"", ""Heart Smart"", etc...I know there are good-tasting products out there with these words in the title (I prefer diet soda and Crystal Light to surgared drinks), but if I see the above words on anything else, psychologically I shut down. I actually bought these to make for a pot luck that included diabetic colleagues and in a period of open-mindedness, made some for my family. Not. Bad.<br /><br />I sprinkled chopped pecans on top before baking - they smelled great cooking, looked good cooling off. I stared hard at the brownies before cutting myself a piece and...wait for it; I was pleseantly surprised! In fact, they were so good that I helped myself to another slice, but after the 2nd helping I could taste whatever sweetener subsitute they use. Fine by me - this will ensure I don't overload in a moment of weakness.<br /><br />My husband stuck them in the fridge and while still good, they take on a more fudge-like texture. We both thought they tasted like Little Debbie Brownies. He loves them! I glad I trusted the reviews on Amazon and wanted to share my own thoughts for other skeptics like me. If you would like to find ways to reduce your sugar intake without living without chocolate, I recommend these (but just one serving!). Enjoy!"	0	0
		A1VVTV9IBFDJU6	Did it work?	I had to add lots of honey and some milk to help dilute the strong licorice taste, but after doctoring it, it tasted pretty good. I'm still not sure if it helped increase my milk supply. It might have been all the pumping that I did. Before pumping I guess there was a *slight* increase, but nothing ups lactation like good old fashioned increase in demand. I'll keep it around just in case, but it won't be an absolute necessity. (I've been breastfeeding for 2 1/2 months when my supply began to run low.)<br /><br />Bottom line, it's fixed now. *shrugs*	2	0

		A1EJKV8JY54E2L	Save your money - this stuff is gross	I bought this on a whim while I was grocery shopping.  No calories, no fats and no carbs seemed too good to be true.  The ingredient list was a little scary but I thought it might be worth a shot.  Big mistake.  This stuff is nasty tasting.  To me it tasted like sickly sweet chemicals.  The healthier I eat, the more I can taste the chemicals in processed foods such as this.  If it had actually tasted anything like peanuts it might have been ok but that sickly sweet taste is just gross.  I'd rather just give up eating peanut butter altogether than try to replace it with this spread.	1	0

		ATT8UCBP9TWO6	Delicious, Affordable Coffee	I've always been an avid coffee addict and in an attempt to save on extra spending, I got in the habit of brewing my own coffee everyday. Usually I just bought whatever was on sale (including the large, 20+ oz jugs), but never online. When I saw the Amazon Subscribe & Save option, I thought it could be a great way to keep my coffee cheap and always stocked.... And I was right! I think Folgers 100% Colombian is already a great product, and the amazon.com shipment was simple, fast, and at a great price. I go through the 27.8oz jug in a few weeks, so for me there's no issue with freshness. Each jug is sealed so that when you do need it, you're opening it fresh anytime.<br /><br />I'm definitely going to keep subscribing (and saving!) to this product with amazon.com - an all-around great buy!	0	0

		A1VDPAUBS71M1B	Greatest mild Louisiana style hot sauce	Crazy Uncle Jester's Louisiana Firestorm is the best pure Louisiana style hot sauce, but Crystal is my favorite of the original style, milder Louisiana style hot sauces that I can buy in a supermarket.  It's about twice as hot as the original Louisiana style hot sauce, which still is not all that hot but the extra cayennes add a lot of flavor and are the difference between being 99% vinegar (like tabasco) and hot sauce IMO.<br /><br />I buy this one mainly for my 8 year old son, who hasn't yet migrated up to the hotter Louisiana style sauces and he loves it. I'll use it myself from time to time as well, although I usually opt for something hotter.  It's still good tasting.	0	0

		A3VL1D9CLW6NWK	Look no further	I don't own any cats but I got this for my friends cats (who I think are awesome). The cat nip they normally use was getting a bit old and wasn't working as well as it used to. I wanted to get the kitties something nice for Christmas, so I looked on YouTube and saw some videos for cat nip spray. It looked like it worked pretty well on the videos.<br /><br />After looking at reviews for other products, I was hesitant. This was the only 5 star product and despite there being only 2 reviews I decided to take a chance. I am glad to say this product did not disappoint.<br /><br />As soon as I recieved the spray I pumped it a couple of times to prime it and I sprayed it ONCE on accident. No big deal, right? Litterally, one minute later: here come the kitties from the other room. THEY LOVED IT! I don't think I have ever seen them this playful on ONE ACCIDENTAL spray.<br /><br />I sprayed a couple of new toys that I also purchased through AMAZON. Again, one pump was plenty and they went nuts yet again! I wish I had taken a video of it to put up on here. I would definately purchase this product again. If you love to crack out your kitty then look no further. You will not be disappointed.	2	0

		A252P74Z28I84T	Great product, hard to find at my grocery store	Very happy to find this Cruet combo here on Amazon.  Shopping Star vendor sells at store prices and almost next day delivery.<br />Most grocery stores do not stock this Cruet dressing set anymore for some reason. Best Italian tasting dressing you can make or modify to your own taste. Will be stocking up on this item!	2	0
		A2SD2F8X5H2JTU	Refreshing	I like the concept of a mix, so there is less packaging involved. This coconut water is slightly sweet and refreshing. Nothing can match the real thing, fresh from a coconut, but it's not bad for Michigan!	0	0
		ADKEVBX1KGUVQ	Healthy sport drink alternative	I found this product to be a great alternative to sport drinks. It is loaded with potassium but does not have the salt and sugar found in traditional sport drinks. The flavor is a little bland by itself so I add a little unsweetened fruit juice and it really fits the bill. Highly recommended!	0	0

		AMZU6GUXP5U57	Tastes ok, but instants clog Keurigs	"It wasn't until my Keurig got ""backed up"" and only dispensed a half-cup that I realized these were instant and as such, required special cleaning. These are not the brew kind so after making a cup, you need to run 1-2 cups of water through the Keurig or the needle and bottom of the filter dispenser/spout (I have no idea what it is called) gets clogged. I clean my Keurig frequently, but these and the hot cocoas are really not worth the hassle of two cups of water after every cup I make. The cappuccino tins from like International Coffee or a packet of swiss miss, etc are much less fuss.<br /><br />As others posted, the taste is off as well. If you want to know what they taste like, go to your local gas station and find the ""caramel cappuccino"" dispenser and try that."	0	0
		A2FW4SJM0LSG6P	Long time customer...	I have always bought Whisky Sour Mix by the case from Brady Enterprises.  You can't go wrong with any of the mixes.  We also use the Appletini and Cosmopolitan with rave reviews.  Ice, liquor(s), packet & shake.. that's it!  I also make Whisky Sours with vodka (so I guess that's a vodka sour) and a 1/2 shot of Cointreau.  For those who like to cut the sour (tartness), use a dribble of marashino cherry juice & a cherry.  These mixes have been used by my father-in-law, uncle, & aunt since the days of Johnny Carson.  Enjoy!  Slainte!  Cheers! Kampai! Salute! Gsundheit!  Whatever!	0	0
		A2TV76GPHJE1U1	Stay Away!!!	This is one of the WORST k-cup coffee varieties I have tried. I have been enjoying Tully's Italian Roast, but something is messsed up with the pricing on Amazon (like: it is twice the price I paid for it last time!) So, I figured I would try the Timothy's instead. What a mistake!!!  It is bitter, weak and truly disgusting. I wouldn't subject my worst enemy to this one.	2	4

		AKJ6LLQA3GWCH	good value for good coffee	"These coffee pods work great in the Keurig Brewer, and if you like the flavors available these are a good value, but at our local warehouse club (BJ's New England) we got a box of 80 for around $28.00. This is way less than here at Amazon. I hope they create more flavors. As for the ""off taste"" other reviewers are complaining about this coffee is a branch of Peets Coffee. They roast a lot differently than Green Mountain Coffee, the people who bring you the Keurig brewers. I find the coffee to be robust and a lot less bitter than Starbucks, but more bitter than, say, a Dunkin Donuts coffee.<br /><br />I would buy these again and again, but as I said, our local warehouse store had them for even less. Shop around!"	0	0
		A3QUI753D3EAD	Try this tea!	This tea is great, if you like chamomile and black licorice. The taste is not overwhelming, just hints of both flavors mixed with other subtle pleasant aromas.

		A3FJIFYP9W5J4G	great gobs of cookies!!!	These make great cookies.  I think they have the right amount of chocolate chips and they taste fabulous.<br /><br />Be sure to use real butter.  In GF cooking, margarine doesn't work as a substitute...I tested it too and margarine cookies tasted terrible, looked even worse and crumbled into a million pieces.  Butter (as box calls for) were perfect and delicious.<br /><br />These will definitely be my go-to for chocolate chip cookies!  I hope Betty Crocker begins to make other Gluten Free items as well!	38	1

		A31J9RMH7YA2CI	Good for low-carbing, nice strong flavors	I got these because I'm on a low-carb, high-fat diet and was wanting something high-fiber that also packed a bunch of omega 3s. These fit the bill pretty perfectly! The flavors aren't all winners, but they're all really strongly flavored which is fantastic for a crispy snack. I like the flavors of these more than I like the flavors of potato chips, honestly.<br /><br />They don't strike me as slimy when you chew them, but your mileage may vary - I mean, yeah, the texture is a bit odd (imagine chewing a bunch of sesame seeds, similar kind of texture) and they do get stuck in your teeth, but hey - that's flax seeds for you. If you don't like (or tolerate) the texture of flaxseeds, there's nothing these crackers can really do for you.<br /><br />The flavors: My favorite is the Mexican flavor, hands-down. A close second is the hemp (rosemary! nom nom!) and the cinnamon maple (higher-carb, but only barely. Really cinnamony). I'm not really a fan of the onion garlic and italian... I love garlic, but it's just too much. The original flavor is icky, it just tastes like soy sauce and flax. Meh. I like soy sauce, but it's not really an ideal flavor for crackers! If you like Japanese rice crackers you might like that flavor.<br /><br />I think the cinnamon maple would probably be a fantastic flavor to spread nut butters on (chocolate almond butter, almond butter, peanut butter, whatever).	3	0

		A3A77RIYVNT3ZS	My Favorite of all the Crystal Light flavors	If you love drinking Iced Tea, this version is great.  It's tastes like any sweetened lemon iced tea you would get from a store to a restaurant and os very refreshing.

		A3KJUQVN7ZLREI	Our Dogs Love Them	"Our dogs love the basted gravy bones by milkbone.  The only problem is they are not readily available to buy in the stores!

		AENXJM2CKEN5L	Fresh Step Scoop-able Cat Litter, Multi-cat, 25 Pound Box	Fresh Step Scoopable Cat Litter, Multi-cat, 25 Pound Box<br /><br />My cats prefer this brand of litter.  I've tried others, but this is their preferred.  I tried a side by side comparison and the cats didn't use the other brand when they could choose.  So, to keep my cats happy, this is the form and type of litter they want.<br /><br />Those of us who own cats know they can be picky and that goes without saying, their choice in litter is important to their overall health.  It's scoopable so it makes clean up easier and the carbon eliminates odors from urine and feces.  Fresh Step has gone through several updates to its product and this new improved odor control is the best formulation yet and it has a pleasant scent.<br /><br />I fill the litter box with 3 to 4 inches of Fresh Step Scoopable, as the cat uses it, the scoopable formula works well to clump around the liquid waste and makes disposal easier of both liquid and solid.  Disposal in the trash is quick and easy and I refill the litter box back to it's original depth and the cats are very happy.  The odor eliminating carbon works 24/7, multi-cat formula fights bacterial odors, and the high-quality clumping clay clumps tight to help prevent leaving behind stinky crumbles.<br /><br />But remember this, I completely change all the litter in the box once a month and wash and dry their litter pans for best results.<br /><br />This is my cat's choice, so who's to argue, a good 5 scratches... oops 5 stars is their opinion.  For my cats this is the best litter and it is important to use a pooper scooper on getting the clumps out.  The more clomps that are remove the happier the cat will be and they will continue to use the litter, by having a box or to as back ups for those days the store is sold out or the weather is so bad you just can't get out to bring it home.  It's better to have more on hand, then have a carpet dumpling to clean up.	0	0
		AY1EF0GOH80EK	WONDERFUL MIX!	I like to bake whole wheat breakfast foods for my family and this mix makes it super easy and they turn out so good.  The whole wheat gives it a sweet nutty crunch to the top of the muffins.  It is hard to find a whole wheat mix that tastes fresh because whole wheat flour begins to degrade as soon as it is milled, I don't know how Hodgson Mills does it since these are preservative free, but they really taste fresh!  Each box of mix is the size of a Jiffy mix and makes 6 large size muffins or 20 mini muffins.  I bake mini muffins at 400 degrees on the convection setting in my toaster oven and they are done in 7 minutes, great in the summer when you dont want to heat up the house.  I highly recommend!<br /><br />PS> Just an FYI on the price: I paid about 8 bucks for an 8-pack of boxed mixes using sub & save with amazon, so about one dollar a box.  I notice that when amazon has them out of stock another merchant on here is selling the 8-pack for THIRTY dollars plus TWELVE dollars shipping, WOW, that is the most unethical markup I have ever seen since the Hodgson Mills website sells them for close to a dollar a box too if you buy a 6-pack.  DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY PAYING MORE!	4	0
		A1STNM7U2WM1HN	sparkling clean dishwasher	This product works wonders in my dishwasher. I live in the midwest and we have hard water. My dishwasher began having a white film on my glasses and dishes. The dishes weren't looking clean anymore and the inside of the dishwasher had the film all over. I tried running a cycle with vinegar and that helped some, but I was worried that my dishwasher was going to have major problems. I read about using citric acid cyrstals to remove the film. With no luck at finding citric acid around my area, I ordered it from Amazon. I got it quickly and used it immediately. It took 3 cycles to really remove the film and make my dishwasher look like new. Using the citric acid every couple of weeks keeps my dishwasher sparkling clean.	6	0
		A371B3Z09W4GT5	Excellent berry tea	"This is a very nicely balanced tea. Though my favorite has always been ""tastes of summer,"" this tea is very delightful too.

		A1O8B339CM5VAU	Add some Rice on the Side	Cook some Basmati rice and you have a meal for two.  This is an excellent product and doesn't need any additional ingredients.  Tastes almost as good as authentic Indian restaurant food.<br /><br />EDIT:  Changing the rating.  This last batch was a little bland.  It tastes OK, but not great like before.  With previous packages my wife and I would practically lick our bowls clean! With this last order, there is flavor missing.  It no longer has the strong spicey taste to it like the restaurants do.  We are really hoping it was just a bad batch.	6	0
		AS96O4LS4ZC83	Yummy	This flavor is almost impossible to find in the stores and it has quickly become my all time favorite. I ordered it from Amazon and got it the next day without having to pay any special NextDay air charges. The price I paid on here was also cumulatively lower than had I purchased it at a store (though they do not stock it). Win all around. If you haven't tried this flavor, I highly suggest you do, it's like a cinnamon roll with vanilla frosting in your cup. Combine that with a nice dark roast coffee and you get pure bliss in the morning.	0	0
		A2W8EMNZ5TWWXO	Best bread ever- ridiculously easy to make.	I've tried about a thousand different packaged gluten-free bread mixes, making bread for my girlfriend.<br />I've tried gluten free flour that replaces regular flour 1-to-1.<br />They have all turned out mediocre at best, inedible at worst<br />Kobe beef burgers with absolutely inedible buns),<br />with all the loaves being small, dense, and not much rise or loft.<br />This was the happy opposite.<br />I don't have a bread machine, but I followed the simple instructions- water, butter, eggs, mix for three minutes. Seriously, three minutes, and then turn out into the pan, smooth with wet hands or spatula, cover and let rise.<br />It cooks in only 30 minutes(!!!), and is done when it sounds hollow when thumped. Every other recipe I've ever tried cooks for 45-60 minutes until it reaches an internal temp. of 190-210.<br />I let this rise on the stove top for 45 minutes as the oven pre-heated, and then put it in to bake. I about had a stroke when I checked on it, and it had risen over the top of the pan to make a regular sized and shaped loaf. Mine finished in about twenty five minutes. I unpanned it immediately and let it cool on a rack for about thirty minutes. I sliced several pieces, and they were moist and tender, and tasted like regular bread.<br />If I could give this six stars I would.<br />Two quick notes,<br />Gluten free breads are fragile- you must let them cool before you slice or handle them.<br />When you cover the bread to let it rise, I used a sheet of plastic wrap I smeared with Crisco. It really worked well to stop the risen bread from sticking to the plastic, and allowed the plastic to be removed without peeling the skin from the loaf.	2	0

		A2BLWKWPRVIRPQ	Perfect gluten free baking mix!	This is a great mix for pancakes and waffles, but it does so much more!  It's a perfect blend for muffins and quick breads and I've made some excellent chocolate chip cookies with it too. One good thing to know is that you do not want to cover your baked goods with plastic wrap or foil because they will get soggy, even if they are completely cooled first.  I find that paper works best (I usually use a brown paper lunch bag).  Also, Pamela's website has some great recipes!	0	0

I prefer the DoMatcha ORGANIC Green Tea, but it is too expensive to make smoothies everyday.  2nd Harvest works just as well, and you get so much more!  I use just a teaspoon per smoothie. You will enjoy this Green Tea, you won't be disappointed! (PS-the only reason I gave 2nd Harvest 4 stars is because I prefer Organic!)	6	0

		A2RZAIJD4SEV6Z	Challenging and Durable	"I accidentally bought the large Tug-a-Jug for my little 12 lb Maltese/Jack Russell mix dog. Although it intimidated her as a puppy, she has since come to love this toy and begs to be able to play with it. (I wouldn't suggest small dog owners getting the large toy for their small dogs though. It works for Izzy, but my parents toy poodle won't do much more than sniff at it.)<br /><br />DURABILITY: My main concern with buying toys for Izzy is she can destroy most things in a short amount of time. Toys for ""aggressive chewers"" last a couple hours tops, and the only way I get stuffed squeaker toys is purely for her occasional entertainment. The Tug-a-Jug, however, has not been a problem whatsoever; it's still in great condition, and she's been playing with it for a year.<br /><br />TREATS: I would suggest when they're learning how it works, to fill it with treats like Premier Buddy Berries Dog Treats. They're a training treat and very small. Once your dog figures out how to work the treats out, fill it with something like Zuke's 16-Ounce Mini Bakes Dog Treats. These are larger and create a bigger challenge. Also, of course, dog food works great too.<br /><br />This is a great toy and option for dogs that have energy and enjoy a challenge. It's also entertaining to watch them try to get the treats out :)"	1	0

The package arrived, I tore it open and immediately brewed up a small pot.

I picked up the cup, looking forward to a pleasant cup of real chai and to the joy of a new discovery and WOW! It was FLAVORLESS - I mean below tea-bag quality, below sweepings - no flavor to speak of at all!  Thinking/hoping there must be something wrong, I opened the second can - just as flavorless.  I won't bother opening the third.

		A23L3Z31ROPT74	Good clean tasting water, price point might be a little high.	"I got a few bottles from a friend that ordered it, I freely admit its a good tasting bottle of water. The problem for me is the price point, I am fully aware that its cheaper than most energy drinks of a similar nature, but I don't drink energy drinks solely for the caffeine, there are a host of added flavors and supplements to choose from. This bottled element water while a good tasting alternative is still to put bluntly, a small bottle of water, you could buy a gallon of ""decent"" tasting water at any local store for less.<br /><br />I like the free shipping, but ultimately the cost is just shifted into the base price of the water. This is something I'd definitively buy in a local store if the price per bottle were able to go down, considering the overhead cost a store would bring I don't see that being overly likely anytime soon. Good product, but i'm not in love with the cost."	2	0

I was hopeful that this would be a new cereal that we all would love. Unfortunately I was wrong. We tried it first without milk and it wasn't too bad. But for some reason when you add the milk the flavor almost seems to change a bit and the sogginess doesn't do it any favors. While it's a decent little snack and would be, I'm sure, great for younger children, our family will not be purchasing it again.	0	1

		A5IY506P3XG3N	Thanks, Red Bull!	I first drank Red Bull when, after working all night, a young man advised it.  Seriously, at my age, I felt like passing out.  But I drank the Red Bull, and very shortly felt all right.  I checked, and if you aren't worried about drinking from a can, it has healthy ingredients.<br /><br />A year later I had extreme fatigue from a stroke brought on by high stress.  Red Bull has helped me function as I recouperate.  [BTW, severe fatigue after stroke is helped by raw adrenal tissue tablets.]	0	0
		A3NAMFDCMBNTSV	delicious and convenient	"What a wonderful surprise! Salad in a package that tastes ""homemade,"" as another reviewer also observed. The box includes a packet of dry macaroni and dried veggies that you cook like any ordinary pasta and a smaller spices packet. You need to add mayonnaise (I added some creamy Italian Salad Dressing in place of part of the mayo), but you might be able to figure out some imaginative lower-calorie options. It is so true that everything in the kitchen (and in the world) is chemical, but too many packaged foods with ingredients panels on the box truly taste chemical rather than organic, and this was a delightful and surprising exception. I'd definitely advise adding additional diced and chopped veggies: tomato, cucumber, celery, onion, olive and radish would fit well, wouldn't overwhelm the flavors and would enhance the visual presentation. One of the big pluses is that you can buy up in advance and keep a supply of this Pasta Salad on hand for culinary emergencies of many different kinds."	1	0
		A3O1I9YJR8YWUX	Best Turkey Jerky on the market	Snackmaster's makes the best Jerky I've ever had. All of their Turkey Jerky product are exceptional, but I'm quite partial to the Teriyaki. It has a faint hint of sweetness that's very nice. Most turkey jerkies I've tasted had a slight chemical taste. And most were somewhat powdery. Not the case with this brand. Great taste and nice and chewy.	0	0

		A22Z9R91N8L7IQ	What?  All These Folks Are Right?	I read the nine reviews that preceded me and wondered how a product depending on a person's taste could consistently receive five stars.  Is something suspicious here?<br /><br />Nope!  Here's the tenth five-star rating in a row, and I'm tough.  This is the best sauce of its kind (or any kind) I've ever had; and I'm an old guy who's been around.  Just the right sweetness, just the right hotness.  I'd love to soak a chicken in it, as well as dip egg rolls and chicken nuggets.<br /><br />These big bottles won't last and I'll be back for more, fer shure.  Absolutely more than worth worth the little price, this stuff should be standard in every home, along with plumbing.<br /><br />And my sincere apologies to those other reviewers for doubting you.	23	1

		A3HP9V1D67866V	Finally, a GF ginger snap!	Okay, so they aren't as chewy as the wheat version of a ginger molasses cookie.  They don't quite *snap* like the wheat version of ginger snaps.  Like a lot of gluten-free cookies, they're more crumbly than chewy.  On the other hand, they do give a good kick of that ginger taste I have missed since I have began avoiding wheat years ago.  I also like that these don't have corn in the ingredients list- just rice and tapioca for flour.  So many of the GF alternatives use corn flour, which might work for Celiacs but doesn't always work for those of us who have intolerances that include corn.  I am pretty keen on the idea that I could pulverize these in the food processor and use them for a graham cracker crust.  I think they'd be phenomenal in a trifle or as a pressed crumb layer of a layered cookie.  I've been pretty happy with the Pamela's line of GF products, and this one did not let me down.  This product is going on my permanent Amazon shopping list.	7	0

		AXHETL0M8XZPT	Holy Ginger Batman!	"Wow! They aren't kidding with the ginger in this drink mix! It is all ginger, all the way. I love it though. The drink is almost an indescribably strange flavor with super strong ginger at first, a little hint of sweet, but not too sweet, and a slight twang of lemon. I drank it hot in a small mug and ended up putting a little more water in after a few drinks to lighten it up a bit. I love ginger, so the strong flavor was fantastic to me, but if you don't like a lot of ginger and can't handle the ""ginger burn"" (if you know what I am talking about you most likely enjoy the ginger burn!), then this isn't the drink for you. It mixes pretty quickly in hot water and is a cloudy drink once fully incorporated. It isn't too sweet, which I appreciated, but I imagine you could add honey if you wanted to sweeten it up. All I have to say is this was one ginger filled drink! I bet it is great for a belly ache!"	0	0

		A33REC3J2JU2EL	Amazingly Good!	I do not like pre-cooked pork rinds, not even made fresh in the Mexican Carnecerias, but hubby likes them, so I decided to buy these.<br /><br />I was shocked to find that they were light, airy and crispy. Some bags were saltier than others, but we've cooked up about 5 so far and the majority aren't overly salty.<br /><br />Another reviewer mentioned watching them to figure out how long the cooking time should be. In our 1100 watt oven 40-43 seconds seems to be just right.<br /><br />The key is to take them out the moment the bag has fully inflated. Leave them in too long and you end up with charcoal and not enough time will make them gummy.<br /><br />Since I follow a fairly low carb regimen for health and weight reasons, I like the fact that these can be a perfect vehicle for guacamole and salsa without the carbs. I'm still trying to come up with more dip ideas that will go well with the flavoring.<br /><br />I wish they'd put out a version that didn't have seasoned salt as I'd like them with just salt and/or garlic.	17	1

I no longer miss the salt as all of Benson's seasonings add so much flavor without salt or potassium chloride."	0	0

		A8P8KPVXCWV9R	Only negative is the pulp	I've tried several of the Alo Coco drinks.  I really only have two complaints.  The first is obviously the pulp.  I have to strain the pulp in order to be able to drink it.  That's a personal preference, though.  I can't drink orange juice with pulp, either.<br /><br />The other negative isn't really a negative but needs to be mentioned nonetheless.  All of the Alo Coco drinks taste about the same to me.  That's not necessarily a bad thing.  I love the coconut flavor, and I love the fact that I can simply shop for whichever is the least expensive.<br /><br />The biggest positive, though, is the hydration quality of the drink.  It is high in potassium, an electrolyte, and I have found that I only need to drink about half of the water as normal while excercising when I have a half bottle of Alo Coco before and the other half after.  It's a great alternative to Gatorade, and for that reason alone, I will continue to purchase Alo Coco.	0	0

		A1SAZB83QFR0W2	Stuff your face without feeling guilty	A hundred percent whole grain cracker, sweetened with honey?  No hydrogenated oils or high fructose corn syrup or artificial preservatives? Just rip off the top of a box while you put on your newest DVD, and pass it around, or eat the whole box by yourself.  Think of the fiber!!!!!  Yes, you won't have a balanced diet, but the label will make you feel good, and the snappy, crispy, crunchy texture will remind you of melba toast but with flavor. Now, these are great crackers, but about going 'back to nature,' well, I'm not quite sure where in nature you're liable to run across these, compared to something like, say, organic apples.	0	1
		A2OWR5G2OAQF7C	quality of the product is great, but a bit gritty in finished product	I like the fact that the recipe provides alternative to some of the ingredients like sugar (replace with honey) and butter (replace with canola oil), which we did since we have moved into more consciousness in the ingredients we are consuming.  The honey option definately tastes better than cane sugar (our other alternative to white and refined sugar); otherwise, it was not that sweet and a bit gritty.<br /><br />I am just pleased to have a package ready that I only need to throw in a few addtional ingredients and I have cornready within 30 minutes.

		A4IL0CLL27Q33	I will stick with 5-hour Energy Drinks	"I usually drink a 5-hour Energy drink<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005GX1K14"">5-Hour Energy Extra Strength (24 Bottles Grape)</a> when I first get up so that I can quickly get in to my morning P90X routine. I put one on my nightstand before going to bed and quickly drink it down in the morning. I don't much care for the taste (though I don't exactly hate it) but I like the effect of energy drinks on my exercise performance, and that is why I decided to give this No Fear drink a try. I was disappointed and will stick with 5-Hour Energy. Here are my thoughts:<br /><br />1 - Calories: At 260 calories a can, there is a 65X difference. It does not fit in with my nutrition goals.<br /><br />2 - Taste: It's a little sweeter than a Red Bull. I don't much like Red Bull though and the flavor of No Fear was not an improvement over 5-Hour Energy.<br /><br />3 - Size: This is a BIG can yet it has roughly the same amount of caffeine, taurine, etc as 5-Hour Energy. Why drink this massive can of fluid when a small shot will do? If I REALLY enjoyed the taste, I might feel otherwise.<br /><br />4 - Energy Boost: I found the effect of No Fear to be similar to that of 5-Hour Energy.<br /><br />Bottom line: 5-Hour Energy works better for me."	1	1

		A1QCUMGX7UHFL5	Strong robust coffee without the bitterness	"I have to admit, I was skeptical as I always am when it comes to flavored coffees. Flavored coffee usually does not taste good at all to me since it almost always comes at the price of having some kind of weird taste associated with the coffee flavor. This vanilla-flavored coffee has done a great job of mixing good coffee and flavoring without too much of that ""weird taste"" to it, however it doesn't altogether avoid it. If I were to wager a guess I'd say that there is some process that adds the flavoring and ensures it doesn't lose its potency which is the culprit for most flavored coffees having that strange taste, usually in the form of what I can only call a chemical-taste. Starbucks has minimized this, thankfully.<br /><br />I brew mine on the strong side, and usually put in more than what the package calls for because otherwise the coffee winds up on the weak side. Don't do that with this brand, or at least with this line of their brand. They are right on the money with the measurement. The first morning I brewed this it opened my eyes, but only because it was overwhelmingly strong. The next day it was much better after I toned down the amount. The brew turned out rich, strong, bold, and the vanilla flavor is very much a part of the aroma and taste. You won't need to worry about a weak pot of coffee that looks watery and tastes thin.<br /><br />The 11-ounce bag lasted about 2 weeks, with me drinking a pot brewed with 4 cups a few days a week. If you like flavored coffee, you will more than likely enjoy this and I'd say give it a shot. If you're a big coffee snob, then it's probably not for you. For the record I'm a borderline coffee snob, and although I wouldn't go out of my way to order it, I wouldn't turn down a cup if it was offered me like some of the other flavored coffees out there."	1	0

		A39I9I0J7UO6Y1	Buddie Bits Review	My three chihuahuas (4 lbs, 8 lbs, 9.5 lbs) love these little treats.  The treats are small so that they are easy on their little mouths and teeth and they are small enough not to contain way more calories that I want them to have (have to keep them trim and healthy).  They are also lightly crispy rather than hard and crunchy (many chihuahuas have dental problems), so I don't have to worry about gum  or tooth damage or pain.  From the response that I get whenever my chihuahuas just see the package in my hand and the way they dance around until they get their treat, I have no doubts about how much they enjoy these little crispy treats.<br /><br />I first purchased Buddy Bones (a bigger treat but same recipe) from my local Pet Supplies store and broke them into smaller pieces because they were larger treats and my little dogs had some trouble chewing them.  Pet Supplies quit carrying these treats so after checking Petsmart and Petco, I was getting a little discouraged.  Then I had the (its seems to most non dog lovers I'm sure) thought to try on Amazon and here they are. Not only did I find the treats my dogs love, but I found a much smaller version and I do not have to break them up into smaller pieces.  Now when it's treat time, my three little dogs don't look at me with disappointment any more.	0	0
		A1I8XG2S5SGHPS	My dogs love them and have clean breathe	No complaints. My dogs both enjoy them and they have nice breathe afterwards. My dogs are 10 pounds each and I got the Teenies. They are very chewy so it takes a bit for my dogs to eat them, but I think that is part of the fun for them. Highly recommend!	0	0
		A37MH7ICH80QOX	Great product	I've used stevia powder for years. NOW is an excellent source at a great price. If you are baking, stevia is not very good for that as it will not give the same texture as white sugar. However, it is outstanding for sweetening tea, coffee and smoothies.<br /><br />Many have claimed that stevia is 200 times as sweet as white sugar. I don't agree. To my taste it is no more than 16 times as sweet.<br /><br />Be careful about using too much because it slips from sweet to bitter to the taste when that happens.	1	0
		A1TBVQ8R75FQKA	My dogs LOVE these treats	I have never had a dog treat that made my dogs respond so quickly!  This treat even got my reluctant standard poodle to start using the dog door, which even steak wouldn't do.  The aroma of these treats is pleasing, even to me, and the size is perfect for both the standard poodle and the mini doxie.  The only thing the manufacturer could make better is the container.  It's a big pain to have to unscrew the lid every time I want just one treat.  Great product.	0	0

		A36FB5QWKQAX4Z	Took a few tries to find the right one.	"When we got our lab puppy I did a lot of comparing different brands of dog food including cost. This is a great deal. A lot of dog foods boast chicken or another meat as the first ingredient but the list is based on weights. If it says chicken followed by a grain of some sort, the grain is probably the most abundant ingredient because the chicken loses around 60% of its weight when cooked. This has chicken-meal as the first ingredient (after chicken) which is cooked and dried when weighed. It doesn't have any corn or wheat products. We used Blue Buffalo at first but it was more expensive and our puppy never had firm stools. We don't have that problem with this. We also tried Castor & Pollux Natural Ultramix but she didn't like it. Organix is a great deal on subscribe and save on Amazon, our puppy loves it, and it is good for her. Now if only I fed myself as healthy as I feed her =)<br />As a side note: the Organix dog cookies were not a hit. For training I highly recommend <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000H0ZJHW"">Zuke's Chicken-Flavored Mini Naturals Dog Treats, 16 Ounces</a>, all 3 flavors are a big hit, and they're the perfect size."	6	0
		A370EX6FWFL8NE	YUM!	"While I love flavored coffees, I had never tried any of the Wolfgang Puck line.  This moved to the top of my favorites list with the first cup!  Not only is the aroma delightful, the flavor is excellent as well.  I drink my coffee black and this one has no bitter after taste and the flavor isn't overpowering.  The flavor is a very light coconut and the coffee is a medium body.  I must admit that I was a little hesitant about a ""coconut"" flavor.  DON'T BE!  Everyone around me wants a cup....I refuse to share!"	21	0
		A2DWNDZQHIA57O	Dissapointing	I bought these to replace the China-made Milo Chicken Jerkey that my retriever would bite your right arm off for:). The EVO treats were dissapointing - He only eats them if I leave them in the crate and he has nothing else to eat for hours.	0	0

I have one pack of these each morning with coffee.  They are very crunchy, so crumbs do drop everywhere. They list whole grain oats as first ingredient and sugar second, but they are just the perfect amount of sweetness. With only 2 grams of fiber, they are not considered high-fiber, but what a tasty way to start the day!  Good price for the 60-bar pack from Toy Ranch at the time I purchased and super-fast shipping with Amazon Prime!"	0	0

		A1SINHLUYMCCRK	Roast is too dark for  a Yirgacheffe	While the roast is  described  as medium it is actually a nice but slightly bitter dark roast which is completely without the promised floral notes that are expected in a good Yirgacheffe Ethiopian coffee. A true medium roast would have preserved the floral and fruity notes that are present in a good Yirgacheffe.  Otherwise, this is an OK feel good coffee for Senseo and Senseo compatible pod cofee makers.  It is both Fair Trade and Organic certified and promotes or sponsors the coffee kicks charity while trading on the Marley name.  However, there is a lot of necessarily sturdy packaging which blunts the organic and sustainable claims for me.  As is standard for Senseo pods, each pod has only enough coffee for 5-6 ounces of strong  coffee. Use two for a mug if you prefer strong coffee.	0	0

		A3CWJ604OXQ4RX	My 'everyday' tea. :c)	I love the idea of having green tea everyday.<br /><br />...However, I thought this could never happen to me because I couldn't seem to enjoy it on it's own.<br /><br /> This is the first 'real' tea I have been able to honestly say; I LOVE. The smell alone makes me smile. It was my answer to wanting to be a 'real' tea drinker. I used to buy boxes and boxes of differing types of herb teas. But those are usually so boring. Almost like Kool-Aid without the guilt. *sigh* Peppermint used to be my 'safe' go to, when out with friends, but often times I found them to be weak or lacking. Stash organic black and green chai, really does it for me, and nearly everyone else I introduce this tea to, feels the exact same way: They wanted to be 'real tea' drinkers, couldn't stand the taste, found this and voila!<br /><br />I do add sugar so, it tastes more like desert than tea... but even when I don't add a bunch, this tea can actually take the 'less sugar' test. Can it hold up, without sugar?? Yes, even then, but, sugar is pretty much a must for me.<br /><br />All that said: Because of this tea, I now enjoy green tea on it's own! How that came about: Getting familiar the 'green tea flavor' when it tastes this fantastic, helped me familiarize with the flavor of green tea. After trying this, I moved on to Stash's 'Green Chai' so now I'm quite familiar with the green tea taste. Thus, I sometimes surprise myself and just drink plain old green tea! Hooray!!<br /><br /> TMI? Likely, but maybe someone will find this helpful and take the leap. :c)<br /><br />PS Thank you Amazon for making this available here!!! I could only find it in one store in my hometown (I store, I otherwise NEVER go to) and NEVER anywhere else! Imagine my joy finding it readily available here. :c)	0	0

I didn't want any other flavor or brand.  So, I just took a chance on Amazon and there it was.  The product was priced right and available in a larger quantity than the stores had offered, when they had it.  I absolutely like the accessibility of products virtually at my finger tips.

		A3H4YP5FGUI9T6	"My new ""must-have"" in the morning"	I think this tea is outstanding, but I'm not a traditional tea drinker.  It's probably already sweet to most people, but I add a packet of Splenda and some Almond Joy creamer to it.  Liquid candy bar I call it, with very few calories!	0	0

		A1AFWUBA7CGK59	Exactly what I expected.	This is your basic Easy Mac.  I actually prefer this packaging over the version that comes with its own little bowl.  If you have a measuring cup that can measure 2/3 of a cup, and a bowl, you don't need to get the kind with the bowls, which I find wasteful.  Either way, they are a great snack.  I think they have 260 calories, so they are not a meal.  Either way, if you've had Easy Mac before, and like it, this is the same stuff.  If you are picky about your macaroni, this is not the macaroni for you.<br /><br />If you really find it bland you can always do what I do an put a little bit of sriracha in right before you eat it.	5	0
		A311QT2NYDS6UD	Great Concept, But Where Are the Directions?	There is really nothing I love more than a great cup of coffee. However, if you want to make a great cup of coffee, then you need directions to show you how to get the most out of the coffee you are using.<br /><br />Although this coffee should be foolproof,(they are single serving bags, similar to a tea bag) there are no directions in the package to tell you how to make the best cup of coffee possible.<br /><br />I would like to have known things like:<br /><br />How much water do I use?<br /><br />Will filtered or distilled water make a better cup of coffee?<br /><br />How long should I soak the little coffee pack in the water?<br /><br />How hot should the water be for the best brewing?<br /><br />The company has a great concept. They want to offer you a great cup of coffee, that's environmentally friendly, and they want to help kids at the same time. You've won my heart. However, they had all the information you need to know about the company, its ideology, causes they support, and even where the coffee comes from and how the coffee is produced.<br /><br />Like I said, there were no brewing recommendations/directions on the package or in the box. If you don't mind a little trial and error, this is a great product. Get it right, and the coffee tastes great.	0	0

		A1UL2JH7XOUGM5	Great taste, give it a shot!	I happen to be a person with acid reflux that drinks large amounts of coffee.  In fact, the coffee may be the cause of my acid reflux!  While I have not used Puroast long enough to see if it cures me, what I can say is that it TASTES GREAT!  I am going to order some more of this just for the flavor, and will see if over time my acid reflux is reduced as well.  So, if you have acid reflux, give this coffee a shot - you'll enjoy it for the taste at least!!	0	0
		A3VRLOIWB2W05N	Not much flavor	The flavor is just OK. I get a hint of some fruitiness once it hits the tongue, but it disappears and tastes a little bland right after. It's also a little sweet for my taste, compared to other red table wines I've had. It almost seems more like a ros&eacute; rather than a red (or maybe I didn't make it right). It's a cheap wine kit with free shipping so I went with it. I probably won't buy again. If I do, it might be to use it as a base and experiment with adding other flavors and oak to enhance it.	0	0

		AO0HPTFIKQE9B	fruit candy great idea	I personally like the flavor of these twisted fruit sticks and more importantly my kids enjoy them also. (two and four years old). Basically these are like fruit roll ups with a heavy concentration of fruit juice that gives him a strong tart flavor. Their texture is similar to soft licorice in addition they throw in a few vitamins but not so many that you have to worry about toxicity. I also tried their mixed berry flavor and would definitely recommend strawberry.<br /><br />I feel adults can use these as a healthier candy or my kids can eat these with a lower probability of creating a mess that sometimes occurs with fruit roll up treats.	1	0
		A1OAE2FSDZAXTL	Tasty popcorn that doesn't get stuck between your teeth!	"Okay, maybe the heading exagerates just a tad... Red Popcorn has a MUCH more tender husk than regular popcorn does and when it pops, it explodes the kernel so well that the husks basically disappear.  When it pops, it looks pretty much like any other popcorn, except that the popped kernels are slightly smaller than usual.  The meet is white, but you can see the little bits of red kernel in them.  You would never know that the pretty, white popcorn you were eating started out red-colored if you hadn't seen it before popping.<br /><br />The flavor is great!  It smelled ""toastier"" as it was popping than other popcorns we've tried.  We tried it all different ways, with toppings ranging from sweet to savory and every way was good.<br /><br />We also liked the fact that it is grown by Amish people and are happy to support their efforts to raise their crops the ""old way.""  They believe in sustainable farming and a clean, wholesome way of life.  No ConAgra multi-national conglomerates here, just real, individual farmers making a living off their land.<br /><br />Great products raised and produced by real farmers.  What better reasons do you need to buy some of this really tasty popcorn!?"	46	2
		A2BETN6Y2DEFZ1	Healthy alternative to candy!	I'm a candy addict, but I love fruit, too, so when fresh fruit isn't available, I love having dried fruit for snacking. The difference between these packaged fruits and some other dried fruit snacks is that these are freeze-dried and crunchy, with no added sugars, while the others are chewy & moist, and usually processed with sugar to sweeten & preserve freshness. These are great additions to yogurt, cereal, desserts, baking, and so on. They store well in a cool, dry place, & do have to be kept in an airtight container to keep them crunchy, because if they absorb moisture they get rubbery. Also, it's best to consume them by the freshness date because even when they're still sealed after months of storage, eventually they will lose their crunchy texture due to air seepage. The freeze-drying retains all the flavor, and I presume much of the nutrients, also.	0	0

		A3W316770WKDYD	Smaller than I thought...	By the look of it, it looks like a round item.  It wasn't.  It was just like a little cap.  BTW, it also didn't last as long as I thought it would.

		AIODQVA7W10YL	Good and strong coffee	I've enjoyed the Dark Magic coffee and re-ordered several times.  What I like about it is the strong taste and dark roast.  This is definitely one that I brew on the biggest cup size (12oz on my unit).<br /><br />The only negative I have is the lingering flavor is not quite as good as some of my more favorite k-cups.  However, I still put this in my top 10 and will continue to order occasionally for variety's sake.<br /><br />Overall - I recommend this to anyone who likes a strong, dark brew.	0	0
		A7EU2BWLLCJY2	Great for iced tea!	"Over the years I have tried making iced tea out of dozens of different herbal teas and most just end up tasting like lightly-flavored water.  This Yogi Sweet Thai Delight tea is the first I've tried that I will make again.  As a matter of fact, I intend to have a jug of it in the refrigerator all summer!  The taste is amazingly sweet (but not in a sugary way) and a little nutty (actually ""coconut-ty."")  I don't use sweeteners or milk in my tea as a rule, but even if I did I wouldn't want to add sugar to this tea, it's perfectly sweet as it is.<br /><br />Since there's no recipe for iced tea on the box, I just winged it and put 8 tea bags into a gallon of boiling water, then turned it down and let it steep covered for about twenty minutes.  You could probably also make it the way my Mom made tea in the summer, by putting the bags in a gallon jar, adding room temperature water, sealing it and setting it in the sunniest place in the yard for the day.<br /><br />However you make it, you really should try this tea iced.  I'm not a huge tea drinker normally, but I'm completely hooked on this one."	0	0

		A37RIRXE3WECZ	reGen Chocolate Muscle Recovery Beverage	I like this muscle recovery beverage after the end of a workout (I do an hour-plus 6 days a week, cardio and weight training), because after working out, I find I have kind of a panicky feeling, because I'm hungry.  I don't really know how much someone like me needs a fancy muscle recovery beverage, but the reGen beverage definitely helps get rid of that so-hungry-I'm-panicking feeling.  The taste is pretty good for this kind of beverage.  It reminds me of a Hunt's Snack-Pack Chocolate Pudding, just thinned a little.  And I really mean a little  You want to shake this stuff up good, because it's thick.  I'm a little conflicted on the 200 calories per serving, though.  I've read that if you drink some chocolate milk made with skim milk, that's a good post-workout drink, too, costing less calories than this one does.  But this is shelf-stable, easily portable, and for this kind of beverage, tasty.  If you're in the market for this kind of beverage, this one's a good pick!	0	0
		A1BP3Y74NK3XTA	Not Jamaican at all, just another sweet, flavored coffee!	I wish Amazon would require any coffee with sweet artificial flavorings to be plainly identified as such.

This stuff tastes the way I imagine Newman's Own Extra Bold coffee would taste with curdled, spoiled Bailey's Irish Cream dumped in it - nasty.  Shudder!!!	2	1
		A20DDH4NT6Q1E8	Good taste, crunchy in milk	"Oatmeal Squares by Quaker is a good tasting cereal, although I personally don't think it tastes anything like Quaker oatmeal with brown sugar (I am a fan of the instant, hot cereal packs), which is what I was expecting.  The squares themselves are only tiny, about 1/2"" so several fit on a spoonful at a time.  They are crunchy in milk, but the brown sugar is so subtle I didn't really notice it at first.<br /><br />I actually preferred the taste of these as a dry snack food (without milk) and then you get a better hint of brown sugar (although I still don't think they taste like oatmeal I was expecting!).  I still prefer my Quaker oatmeal as the instant, hot kind that you just tear open pack, add to a bowl, and pour hot water over.  Regardless, these Oatmeal Squares are just as filling as the hot oatmeal by Quaker, and a good way to start the morning."	0	0
		AI2QEL3OFLB9W	BEWARE!  Picture is not what you get!	My westie and yorkie eat this canned food and I thought I might find it slightly less expensive on Amazon.<br />I found this one and saw the picture of the large dog food which is normally what I buy at the pet store.  It appeared cheaper by a little after considering the shipping cost.<br />I was very disappointed in finding out after shipping cost I actually paid .54 cents more than my pet store!  But then it was worse!!! The cans were more than half the size of the picture!  I contacted customer service and told them I should have read the description, however, the picture was of the larger can.  They offered a return, I would have been stupid again to pay $16+ total in shipping to and from to get a $14 credit.<br />I told customer service the picture was misleading and she said she wasn't sure on this product, but in the past they've told Amazon they have wrong pictures on certain items and Amazon does nothing about it! I don't know if it was their fault or Amazon's fault, but I do know I paid DOUBLE!  I have purchased a lot of items on Amazonb and this is the first time I've felt CHEATED.	1	2

		A12IRGQLFE4EBA	Hot dishwater...?	Never having consumed dishwater I can only imagine that Oregon Chai is what it might taste like.  Having had superb chai at my local Indian restaurants, I assumed (wrongly) that I wouldn't be able to recreate the exquisite experience that is an awesome cup of chai.  I found my exquisite cup of chai by chance ... literally picking a brand at random (Third Street Chai -- -- beyond awesome).  Then I tried Tazo Chai -- -- very average.  Then I tried Oregon Chai... this is the weakest, most tasteless chai I've consumed thus far.  It literally almost tastes like nothing.  I can barely detect the spices that are common in chai nor can I even taste the black tea!  I'm surprised at the 5 star reviews for this product.  If the 5 star reviewers were bowled over by something this tasteless, Third Street Chai would rock their socks and send them into the stratosphere.  Try Third Street, folks... way better than Oregon Chai.	4	1
		A10TN1JAVPHKWR	Excellent WF/GF brownie mix!	We've eaten Pamela's Brownie mix for years.  My kids actually prefer it now to wheat brownies. And now at Amazon, buying by the case AND via autoship, its the best price I've ever found!	3	1

		A3KYCZ5135W5AX	Tastes very good	I'm not a coffee conniseur but these beans taste good.  Not too strong or bitter.  This is the only bean I've ordered on a regular basis.	0	0
		A2EPIQSV4NUSFI	Not the greatest, but not the worst either.	I drink espresso (moka) daily, and go through a 250g/8.8oz brick in about 2 weeks. In my opinion, this isn't the greatest blend from Lavazza that I've had, but it's not the worst coffee I've had either (it definitely beats the drip coffee I'd otherwise get at work). It's a 70/30 robusta/arabica blend, a dark roast with a fruity though noticeably bitter finish (but not as bad as Starbucks or Peet's coffee). The Lavazza Espresso (black tin, 100% arabica claimed) tastes better than this blend, but after having tried Illy's moka grind, the different blends from Lavazza, Kimbo, Segafredo, and also blends from the local coffee roasters, I actually think that a robusta/arabica blend works best for a moka pot; just not this one. Overall, I'd say that I got what I paid for, but I didn't get what I wanted and I was seduced by the 93 or so 4/5 star reviews for this coffee. I'd really give it a 2.5 or 3 but then again, all taste is subjective, That being said, this is a reasonable coffee (considering taste vs. price), but I'll probably switch back to my regular (and unfortunately more expensive) blend.	16	3
		A2TPH171QFO6ZH	Nice Starter for Loose Leaf Teas	My mother and I are just starting to drink loose leaf tea.  I like the taste of these green teas, especially the green paradise.  It's very delicious.  I like that I get to sample a few flavors and I'm going to try the chai sampler soon as well as a few others.  The packaging and tins it arrive in would make it an EXCELLENT gift for anyone, and I like that I don't have to keep them in a bag and instead can use the tins to keep them.	2	0

		A156P4FPL8OGXB	For Chocolate Lovers	This soft, gooey cousin to Chips Ahoy's crisp chocolate chip cookie, has much to offer for the chocolate lover. The almost-like homemade taste and softness gives the cookies a freshness not found in other similar cookies. In addition to white and dark chocolate pieces inside the cookie, is a delicious fudgey center. A chocolate cookie, with dark and white chocolate pieces, and a fudge center! Can it get any better?<br /><br />Whereas one cookie, most often isn't enough, these cookies are so rich that one cookie is plenty for an after-lunch, after-dinner, or anytime snack. The soft, chocolately, fudgey goodness goes great with a glass of cold milk or a bowl of vanilla ice cream.<br /><br />The package is also resealable, so that you don't have to finish all the cookies in one sitting. If you like chocolate and/or fudge, you'll be a big fan of Chips Ahoy's Chewy Gooey Megafudge cookies.	0	0

You should chew them up completely in order to access all the nutritiion.  Whole seeds are not broken down in your digestion system.  Others may think otherwise but once chewed I liken them to the taste of pecans.  They feel like they would be good for you when you eat them too.	5	0
		AVWLQ4AUXPDX3	Definately see an increase	I purchased this tea after seeing a decrease in my supply when I went from breastfeeding to exclusively pumping.  I still have to suppliment with formula, but instead of feeding 4 bottles of formula a day, i only have to feed 1-2.  I can see this product being great for mother's returning to work that are worried about their supply decreasing by being away from their babies durring the day.  To make this product work, you deffinately still have to make an effort to breastfeed/pump regularly.	0	0

		A3HPRU3NQH6IM7	My Mal-shi loves them	My dog took to these dental sticks the moment I introduced one to him. His breath smells the same as the dental sticks themselves, which is better than how it used to smell. Also, this product gets sort of messy. It might have been because of the saliva that was on the dental stick as he chewed one, but it left marks on the couch (the marks were easy to clean but I'm going to make sure he chews them on the tile floor or the rug instead). Overall, my dog loves them so I will continue being a Get Naked customer.	0	0
		A3R60QF77M9UEB	pinupgirl	I LOVE tea.  But I don't like the caffine so I drink decaf which sometimes lacks body and flavor...or has a odd flavor.  Tetley is great.  The flavor is like their regular tea.  Even when I let it steep a little too long it doesn't get that bitter taste some tea has.  I was thrilled to find it on Amazon as I had to drive some distance to find it and although it was worth the drive I can now get online and order it. Yea!  Thanks Amazon. If you like tea this is one you will enjoy.	0	0

		A2Z5BD8WIU21UQ	Very Pleased.	My spoiled kitty loves this food.  I like that this is grain free and the price is better than other brands.  The food is chunky but not to chunky and it looks better than most cat foods.  I would definitely recommend this food to other cat owners.	0	0
		A1T1F6QRJ2LJU5	Good . . . and over priced	My dogs like these.  Everything the positive reviews say about them is true . . . they're a really good option because they don't splinter easily and it takes a good while for my pack of sniveling, snarling, white hot balls of canine terror (wiener dogs) to wear them down.  They eventually get small enough that they become choking hazards and you have to toss them.<br /><br />I have no hesitation in highly recommending deer antlers as a chew for dogs.  It's only that after first buying this brand, I then ran across real, honest to goodness deer antlers that were comparable to these in every way at a local pet store for almost exactly half the price of these.  If you can't find real antlers locally or online for a better price, these are absolutely fine.  But do look around first.	9	0
		A1F7YU6O5RU432	Kids love it	This is definitely a bigger hit with the kids in the house than the adults. It's a fast and easy way to make a quick drink that's got more flavor than water, but not as sweet as Kool-Aid. It's a fun way to add a boost to a bottled water, or a little something to a plain glass of water, without the need for packets of powdered mixes. As with most all concentrated drink mixes like this, you have to watch not to get any on fabric or it will stain, a bit of an issue with kids. My kids like it enough to ask for it as a drink (partially I think because they can make drinks with this themselves), but it's not so great that it will replace the other favorite drinks in the home by the adults. These are a fun idea for taking along on trips as well, since you can skip all the packaging bulk and just take one of these and some reusable drink containers that you fill up with water. Great for those camping, RVing, on long trips or just for keeping in the car to add a shot of flavor to a bland bottled water.	0	0
		AEC90GPFKLAAW	Metallic tasting, and salty	I bought these as an impulse item - we love fresh steamed artichokes, and I sometimes buy artichoke hearts in oil for salads or pizza.  Unfortunately, these aren't that great.  On the positive side, they are crunchy and firm textured.  On the negative side, they are too salty and have a metallic flavor from the can.<br /><br />There are six cans in the pack, so we'll be eating them for a while.  I plan to add them to salads or sauces and not serve them as appetizers (dipped in garlic butter, or stuffed with crabmeat) as I had envisioned.  And I won't be buying them again.	1	0

		A20A9P8EJ5BREG	A nice and tasty start to the day.	This cereal is quite tasty and not overly sweet. There is a nice taste of brown sugar, which seems to more resemble a hint of maple syrup. It also makes a nice snack alternative to popcorn or potato chips. The cereal is enriched with fiber and all of the other vitamin and mineral additives of most other breakfast cereals. It tastes good and is very crunchy, and not too sweet. A nice choice for breakfast, or just good right out of the box.	0	1
		A1L4RDILGM7D9E	Excellent but not perfect	This is a delicious sugar. It has a pretty light brown color and delicious aroma. But the granules are quite big, however -- bigger than plain refined sugar. This makes is difficult to cream butter and sugar together. But if you use it in a recipe where you will melt the sugar first before baking it, or if you use it to brew beer and plan to boil it to melt it, it is a great product. It would be the perfect sugar if only the granules were a bit finer.	0	0
		A2V3FFFM6MV5OM	Tastes great, just not like Postum	I guess on it's own it deserves 5 stars, but because I bought it as a potential replacement for Postum, which it doesn't mimic in flavor or taste. I give it a 4.<br /><br />I ordered this along with Cafix and Pero Extra to try the three and find an acceptable substitute for Postum. I'm a former Postum aficionado and had certainly developed quite a liking to Postum.<br /><br />Really can't take Pero Extra very much. I keep trying it again and again, prolly 10 times now, to see if I can develop a liking for it and just can't. I'm sure some people may like it, but it's just not for me.<br /><br />Cafix is what I'll usually go for, but it has a certain sort of built in slick sweetness (very mild, barely distinguishable)which comes from the beets that are added. Over time I've found it just sort of fills in some of the void from lack of Postum, and while it's not a Postum replica it has certain Postum like qualities.<br /><br />The Roastaroma actually is what I think tastes the best of the three, but its taste is just not at all like Postum, it is however very balanced and has a nice maltiness to it. Often I'll put just a little bit of Stevia powder in it. (I could always tell if I've ingested aspartame by (or nutrasweet, whatever) by how I felt, and try to verify any food/drink I ingest doesn't have aspartame. I mean, an item which arose out of research into nerve agents for warfare, and itself found to be an effective weapon, really shouldn't be passed off as a food item. Stevia is ground plant matter, even less processed that sugar.)The combo makes a really nice morning or late evening drink.	0	1
		A288OGLEBBRJEF	DO NOT BUY THIS BONE, IT WILL MAKE YOUR DOG SICK.	I bought this bone for our 8 month old schnoodle. He loved it, and ate all of the inside 'meat' within two days. True, he shouldn't have been left to eat it so quickly but he also shouldn't have gotten sick. The day after he started eating this bone, he developed diarrhea with some blood for a couple of days. After a week, he is still having loose stool and yesterday he vomited twice. Otherwise, he has been eating his food and drinking water as usual and is playing like he always does so we have been trying to wait for his system to clear up on its own. Another couple of days of these symptoms and we'll be taking him to the vet. Btw, I did a google search on the Dingo brand for any cases of puppies/dogs getting sick and I found multiple hits where people were talking about their dog having the same reaction as ours did. I also found out that there was a recall on another type of Dingo treat 1 year ago. Please look for another brand of bones for your pet, better to be safe then sorry.	1	0

		A3QJM92LOBZJ6P	GREAT!	Our dog loves this food! It has good quality ingredients and it's reasonably priced for the most part. Our dog's coat shines, she barely scratches, no more watery eyes, and her poop is firm and less smelly. All in all, it's great quality food.<br /><br />Plus it's made in the USA which gives me a little more peace of mind about the quality of the food. The only downside is that it smells fishy and the fishy smell tends to linger on my dogs face.	2	0
		A2LB13NU0ORTTF	Best I've tried	I tried this dog food after trying two other brands. My chihuahua mix didn't seem to like the first brand and she had stomach problems with the second. After giving this a try based on the ingredient list and reviews, my dog isn't crazy about it, but she eats it and has well formed stool, so I'm sticking with it for now. I bought the 10 lb bag but it's huge and my dog doesn't eat much so I'll get a smaller bag next time.	1	0

		AHAZF5JB2VNHR	They work, but...	These things catch of lot of whiteflies, but they also catch other insects, such as juvenile praying mantises. And, although it makes me feel good to see hundreds of dead whiteflies stuck on the trap, there are still lots left eating the vegetables. So you will still have to use chemical controls, like insecticidal soap, to reduce the population of bad insects.	0	0
		AIU94ZS3EX8DG	MY DOGS BARK...YUM!	BOTH of my dogs, American Bulldogs, LOVE the Blue Buffalo Large Breed Chicken & Rice Dry Dog food! My 5 year old female American Bulldog is a picky eater and was initially hesitant when she first tried it. After taking a few sniffs and nibbles, she went for broke.  My 2 year old male American Bulldog likes almost anything so he was not a concern.  The price is reasonable and the vendor ships QUICKLY which are two thumbs up in my book.  This was a great experience all around.	5	0

		AACYV0WABH2SW	formerly a frequent Amazon shopper	I had previously purchased this Pedigree chicken dog food for my finicky 1-year-old german shepherd and she loved it.  When my shipment arrived from Amazon I immediately opened a can from the end of the plastic-encased 24-pack and presented it to my dog.  She sniffed it and refused it, so I left it out for her. She kept begging for food, but I would each time point out that she had food in her dish.  She finally ate it, reluctantly, the next evening and then was up all night vomiting. The next day we smelled a dead animal odor that we couldn't locate. Sugar (the dog) sniffed it out for us at the top of the cabinet and we discovered that at least one of the Pedigree cans had burst open and was full of squirming white worms and rotting, oozing liquid that permeated the entire package. I felt so guilty for making Sugar eat something that made her sick, and threw away the entire package. Now I'm afraid to buy the brand again.	3	2

		A26HFSVLAGULIM	JUICY JUICE'S MISSION: STOP BUYING SODA FOR YOUR KIDS: BUY JUICY JUICE	"JUICY JUICE'S MISSION: STOP BUYING SODA FOR YOUR KIDS: BUY JUICY JUICE is a simultaneously self-serving and altruistic mission.<br /><br />Libby's ""Juicy Juice 100% Grape Juice, 46 fl oz"" is part of a larger family of 100% juice products that has taken aim at the huge market share that Coke and Pepsi have carved out for themselves. Their target market is the youth of America. That, more than anything else, makes this and other Libby's products important. I first became aware of this targeting when I was watching the PBS program ""Arthur"" with my youngest child (who is named Arthur). At the end of the show there was a message from Libby's that said, ""Juicy Juice Is Proud To Support Arthur"". Since then I have regularly supported their 100% juice products, although I drink more of them than our Arthur does. Surprisingly, most ""Juicy Juice"" products are significantly less expensive than ""Ocean Spray"" and ""Northland"" juices, though I still buy some of those varieties as well.<br /><br />Though many critics and health advocates have pointed out that fruit juices are naturally high in sugar and after processing, including pasteurization, lose many of their healthful properties, they still represent a healthful alternative to soda for children. Surprisingly this seems to be a controversial statement, but 100% juice [with a little Vitamin C added] does help to engender healthful eating habits which begin with the choice of beverage. It is also a good source of potassium and is an excellent thirst quencher.<br /><br />It doesn't hurt that all of these juices taste very palatable to kids, probably because they are blended to taste sweet without any added sugar. Of course, it would be better to make your own juice, avoid pasteurization [made in a very clean environment], and include the natural vitamins, minerals and pulp, but who really has time. What's more, do you really think a child would drink such a homemade healthy brew? In the meantime, there is ""Juicy Juice"" and our children will most probably drink that thereby avoiding soda.<br /><br />To find out more about this product, see their website at ""juicyjuice"" on the world wide web. They have several useful links to pediatric nutrition sites and ""Frequently Asked Questions"" about their products.<br /><br />[I AM NOT AFFILIATED WITH THIS OR ANY OTHER PRODUCT.]"	0	0

		A27L5L6I7OSV5B	Bland Marley.	To start with, I'll be upfront about a few things:<br /><br />A) I got this coffee free to try through the Amazon Vine program.<br /><br />B) I don't have a pod coffee maker, so I ripped open several bags and put the grounds in a normal filter, making a full 10 cup pot at a time.<br /><br />This said, I'm not in much of a position to assess the pod concept as I didn't use them this way.<br /><br />As far as the coffee itself.  Its fair, but not great.  Like other reviewers have mentioned its pretty weak stuff.  The taste kinda reminds me of a smoother McDonalds coffee.  Not bold by any means, but certainly drinkable if you're open to that kind of thing.<br /><br />I prefer a stronger flavor, so I won't be buying it again.	3	3

		AGL2L9PD2T2T4	O.K., but Not as nice as the prime example in the photo.	This little bonsai was not a prime example like the one in the photograph. Mine is smaller with a more compact shape. It also arrived in a larger and not as decorative a pot. And while it arrived in three days, it was bone dry and some leaves wre bent from the packing peanuts; they are great for cushioning breakable items, but much firmer than plant foliage so do more harm than good. I think now thst maybe I should have indicated it was for a gift (t was but for myself.) in order to get one of their beetter specimens. I guess it will be OK after a few more days of recovery.	1	0
		AKZKG2Z7CNV27	Great Fruit Snacks!	I absolutely love these, healthy and yummy with an awesome texture. Texture is really important to me when it comes to fruit snacks, and these have an awesome soft texture. They aren't hard and you don't have to sit there chewing forever; but if you want you can suck not them and they won't just disintegrate or stick to the roof of you mouth. My personal favorite flavors are the Summer Strawberry and the Berry Patch flavors, but all of them are pretty good. =)<br /><br />Another great fruit snack to try if you like this texture is Ocean Spray brand. They are not organic, but they are less than half the price of these. Mott's Medley's all natural fruit snacks are yummy as well and are made with both fruit and vegetable juices! The Mott's ones are also not organic, and not quite as soft as the Ocean Spray or Annie's, but again, much less expensive.	0	0

		AZFHSPEZUPGD2	Very good corral for 1 horse, maybe 2 with additional electric tape	"I love portable electric corrals.  They are a fantastic option for containing horses while camping, etc.  They are easy to use, give your horse some walking around room,  don't require a level set-up area, are flexible for size/shape, and are  small enough to keep handy in your trailer's tack room.  I much prefer using these to portable panels, high-lining, tying to the trailer, etc.<br /><br />There are many portable corral kits on the market, all very similar with the same kinds of components.  (Except the Zareba EZEE, which is a different animal.)  So I'll give you a component-by-component rundown on the items in this kit.<br /><br />CHARGER - This kit comes with a charger that takes 2 D batteries.  I was leery of this, having had less-than-stellar performance from a 2D charger in the past.  But this one works pretty good, producing a reasonable strength zap with 100 feet of electric tape (with good grounding in damp, solid soil).  If your horse is already accustomed to and respectful of electric fencing, this should be sufficient.  The charger is easy to use, with the fence and ground terminals clearly marked.  The on-off switch is very accessible, and a light and an audible sound tell you when it's on.<br /><br />ELECTRIC TAPE --  This kit is advertised as coming with 200 feet of ½"" tape.  My kit had only 100 feet.  100 feet is enough for one horse.  I don't know where they're coming with up the statement `perfect for containing 4-5 horses for short periods of time'.  No way, not even close, even if I had received the full 200 feet.  Of course, it's easy enough to pick up more electric tape at the farm store.  But beware that the more tape you add on, the less zap you'll get from your charger.  So I'm not sure if the 2D charger would be strong enough with 200 feet of tape.  The tape in this kit comes with a handle pre-installed.  It's a nice handle with a good feel to it, but it doesn't connect nicely to the posts.  I rigged up an extra little tape loop to hook the  handle to.<br /><br />STEP-IN POSTS - These are my favorite kind of step-in posts.  Each post has numerous clips to slide the tape through, so you can set at the right height.  It's very quick and easy to insert and remove the tape from the clips, making set-up and take-down easier.<br /><br />CORNER GUY LINES - This kit comes with some very nice corner guy lines and metal bracing stakes.  Honestly, I'll probably never use them.  With this style of fence, there usually isn't much (if any) tension on the posts, so  I've needed corner guy lines.  Why add to set-up and take-down time?  But if you prefer to use the corner guy lines, I think you'll like the ones in this kit.  They are nice quality adjustable lines, with metal stakes.<br /><br />WIRES, GROUND ROD, ETC -- Of course this kit contains the necessary wires to connect the charger to the fence, and the charger to ground.  The ground rod is a 12"" pointed spike.  Nothing special here.<br /><br />CARRYING BAG - Oh my gosh, A+++ for this carrying bag!  The bag has one long skinny section for the posts, and a separate snap-off zipper tote for the other components.  Within the smaller bag, there  are separate compartments and elastic holders for each piece.  No more jumble of stuff!!!  I love it.  (One quibble - one of the step-in posts had pierced the bag during packing or shipping.  The bag is made of pretty heavy-duty fabric, but not quite heavy-duty enough to stand up to a pointed spike.  And the ends of the bag are not reinforced to avoid this problem.)<br /><br />All in all, this portable fence kit is about as good as any I've seen and would be a reasonable choice for anyone wanting a camping corral.  Just don't expect it to ""contain 4-5 horses "", unless you're rotating those horses in and out one at a time."	4	0
		A3E12BM0TG2ZS8	Forget your hamburger helper!	"I've been using these ""mixes"" for several years and they are so great. Couldn't be an easier meal to prepare. Nice with added veggies-- green or red peppers, carrots, onions, a little potato-  but not necessary to make a very tasty and unique meal.<br />I used to put raisins and slivered almonds on top as a garnish but lately have just been throwing some raisins in to the mix while cooking and it's great that way. My brother adds some pineapple chunks when he makes it. I've given up finding these locally so I have my California people send me some -- but I think Amazon is cheaper."	1	0
		A2E61OQYIVB55P	Dog's Favorite Snack	These chicken chips are devored daily by my 2 toy poodles. High in protein and low in fat make these healthful and senseable for weight control. They are also excellent for training, you don't have to worry about odor or staining when you keep them in your pocket. They also have an incredible storage life. Try them.	2	0
		A38SXAE26HWNWN	Pretty good	We all know jar food is pretty quick and easy... some are even pretty good when you aren't a baby.  I use these primarily as backup when my baby is with her sitter, or when what we are eating isn't baby appropriate.  For the most part, our baby likes these.  She does not care for the peas and brown rice, which is surprising because she loves peas and has likes brown rice cereal.	0	0
		ASSWKDMA1JMGI	As Grace's cousin, I can confirm these are a family favorite!	I've been eating these cookies since they were a family favorite right out of the kitchen. Named for my cousin Grace, her grandmother came up with this recipe years ago and they have been addictive ever since! You won't be able to stop eating them. They are fabulous!	0	0

		AO1HIVTUCQZQ2	Just okay...I prefer Olive Oil for taste	I got this based on the all the positive reviews and was so excited to try this out since I love avocados.  The day I got this, I poured some in a small dish and tried using it as a dipping oil with bread.  I normally use olive oil and love it but love trying new things and was looking forward to this since others said the taste was great.  Well I personally did not like it all as a dipping oil.  I could not get past the first bite of bread and immediately dumped it and got the olive oil.  I've used it in saut&eacute;ing dishes and it is fine for that purpose.  I don't fry food at home so I've never used this other than in regular cooking.  THis is a decent oil if you are in the search for different products to try but I personally prefer olive oil for dipping and cooking and prefer walnut oil for salad dressings.  This is decent but I probably wouldn't buy it again.	4	1
		A2416MUYRI0N4K	Great for everyday needs!	This was orignally purchased because I use it for a scalp conditioner, as well for my hair. This product can be used cooking, but I like using the extra virgin organic coconut oil (not necessarily the same brand) for cooking because it gives off a coconut taste into dishes that make the dish really come to life, comparable to coconut milk, but need less ingredient for the flavor. Anyways, back on topic, this oil can be used as a skin conditioner for the body if used in a homemade lotion. Great product.	1	0
		A3NWMK532EV42W	OK conditioner, but made my scalp itchy	I used this conditioner for one week paired with the shampoo for color treated hair and I'm not impressed.  The smell is a bit strong and chemical-ish.  Plus, even though it is for the scalp, the two CLEAR products made my scalp dry and itchy.  Another bummer is that I learned the product contains an animal byproduct (from cows) and the company does not have a no animal testing policy.  In summary, I won't purchase this conditioner.  I'd prefer something a bit more natural with less chemicals.	0	1
		A3NK1OLP37HOU2	Hot and Good	Everyone wants to know how hot these types of sauces are. On a heat scale, I would rate it 6/10. The best thing about the sauce is its taste, which is pleasant. The heat hits you all up front and doesn't get worse and worse like other ghost pepper sauces. It didn't hit the throat too much, just mostly on the tongue. I would recommend this sauce. Its also a good sauce to start with for a beginner who wants to take the first plunge. A drop goes a long way.	0	0
		A30L38DUJY4YZG	Crawford Garibaldi Biscuits	I was very satisfied with the Crawford Garibaldi Biscuits.<br />They taste better than the Sunshine fruit buscuits that are no longer manufactured in the United States.	1	0
